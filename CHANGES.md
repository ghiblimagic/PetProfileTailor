## 2026-06-02 — TypeScript migration wave 1

### What was built and why

Incremental TypeScript conversion (wave 1): small leaf utilities and hooks with minimal dependencies, following the migration plan. Keeps `strict: false` until most of the codebase is converted.

### Files created

- `utils/fetch.ts`
- `utils/error.ts`
- `utils/stringManipulation/normalizeString.ts`
- `utils/api/checkIfValidContentType.ts` (exports `ContentType` union co-located)
- `utils/debounce.ts` (generic debounce with `cancel` / `flush`)
- `hooks/usePrefersReducedMotions.ts`
- `hooks/useApiRateLimiter.ts`
- `CHANGES.md`

### Files modified

- `tsconfig.json` — added `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` and `noImplicitReturns`; kept `strict: false` and `strictNullChecks: true`

### tsconfig.json choices (and why)

This project is ~95% JavaScript, so tsconfig is tuned for **incremental migration**, not full strictness on day one.

**Left unchanged on purpose**

| Option | Value | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| `allowJs` | `true` | Most files are still `.js`/`.jsx`. Without this, TypeScript would ignore the majority of the codebase and break the gradual rename-and-type workflow. |
| `strict` | `false` | Enabling full strict mode now would surface hundreds of errors across untouched JS files and force a big-bang fix. We flip this to `true` later, once ~70%+ of files are converted. |
| `strictNullChecks` | `true` | Already on before wave 1. Null/undefined bugs are high-value to catch early, and the existing TS files (email templates, hooks) were written with this in mind. Keeping it avoids regressing code that already passes null checks. |
| `include` (`**/*.js`, `**/*.jsx`) | kept | Same reason as `allowJs` — JS and TS coexist in one project until migration is done. |
| `moduleResolution` | `"node"` | Works with the current Next.js 15 setup. `"bundler"` is a later option when we enable full strict and tighten the toolchain. |
| `checkJs` | not enabled | Would type-check every JS file immediately and create a huge error surface before those files have types. Optional `// @ts-check` per file is the safer path for hard modules later. |

**Added in wave 1**

| Option | Why |
|--------|-----|
| `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` | Catches accidental `switch` fall-through — a real logic bug — without requiring types on any file. Safe to turn on during migration. |
| `noImplicitReturns` | Ensures functions with a return type (or inferred return paths) actually return on all code paths. Again, catches bugs without forcing `noImplicitAny` on legacy JS. |

**Deliberately deferred**

- **`strict: true`** — replaces individual strict flags; wait until most files are `.ts` so the error list is manageable.
- **`moduleResolution: "bundler"`** — Next 15 recommendation, but not required while `strict` stays off.
- **`checkJs: true`** — only worth considering file-by-file before rename, not globally.
- **typescript-eslint** — add when enough `.ts` files exist to justify type-aware linting.

In short: keep the door open for JS, enforce null safety on code we already type, add two low-risk bug-catching flags, and save full strict mode for when the conversion is far enough along.

### Files removed

- `utils/fetch.js`
- `utils/error.js`
- `utils/stringManipulation/normalizeString.js`
- `utils/api/checkIfValidContentType.js`
- `utils/debounce.js`
- `hooks/usePrefersReducedMotions.js`
- `hooks/useApiRateLimiter.js`

### Patterns followed

- Co-located types (`ContentType`, hook props interfaces) matching existing TS in `hooks/use-copy-to-clipboard.ts` and `lib/utils.ts`
- `unknown` narrowing in `getError` instead of `any`
- Generic `debounce<T>` for reuse by `useToggleState.js`
- Path aliases unchanged; extensionless imports still work for consumers

### Problems encountered

- None. `pnpm build` completed successfully (exit 0).

### TODOs (deferred by design)

- **`types/` folder:** Not created yet — `ContentType` is co-located in `checkIfValidContentType.ts` until a second consumer needs it. Same for `ActionResult<T>`.
- **`strict: true` / typescript-eslint:** Deferred until ~70% of files are converted, per migration plan.

### Next logical step

Wave 2: remaining `utils/api/*`, `utils/db.js`, then smallest Mongoose models (`NameTag.js`, `NameCategory.js`).

---

## 2026-06-03 — Testing setup (Jest + RTL + Playwright)

### What was built and why

Added Jest, React Testing Library, and Playwright during the TS migration. Jest chosen over Vitest for maturity and existing-codebase applicability.

### Install note

First `pnpm add` failed (`exit 1`) because pnpm `minimumReleaseAge` blocked pinned `@types/bcryptjs@2.4.6`. Retry with `--config.minimumReleaseAge=0` succeeded.

### Files created

- `jest.config.ts`, `jest.setup.ts`, `TESTING.md`
- `playwright.config.ts`, `e2e/login.spec.ts`
- Unit tests: `utils/error.test.ts`, `utils/debounce.test.ts`, `utils/stringManipulation/normalizeString.test.ts`, `utils/api/checkIfValidContentType.test.ts`
- Component test: `components/Shared/ui/skeleton.test.tsx`

### Files modified

- `package.json` — test scripts and devDependencies
- `jest.config.ts` — exclude `migrations/` (avoids picking up `migrations/test.js` as a test)

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 5 suites, 12 tests passed (~9s)
- E2E: run `pnpm exec playwright install` once, then `pnpm test:e2e` (requires build + start; slow first run)

---

## 2026-06-03 — TypeScript migration wave 2 + tests

### What was built and why

Converted remaining small `utils/api` helpers, leaf utils, and the two smallest Mongoose models. Added Jest tests for `bannedWordsMessage` and `detectBotPatterns` per convert-then-test workflow.

### Files created

- `utils/api/cloudinary.ts`, `bannedWordsMessage.ts`, `getSessionForApis.ts`, `detectBotPatterns.ts`, `checkMultipleBlocklists.ts`
- `utils/chooseRandomDefaultAvatar.ts`, `utils/stringManipulation/convertStringToMongooseId.ts`
- `models/NameTag.ts`, `models/NameCategory.ts`
- `utils/api/bannedWordsMessage.test.ts`, `utils/api/detectBotPatterns.test.ts`

### Files modified

- `models/User.js` — extensionless import for `chooseRandomDefaultAvatar`
- `utils/api/getSessionForApis.ts` — returns `response: Response` (401) when unauthenticated (fixes routes that did `if (!ok) return response`)

### Files removed

- Wave 2 `.js` counterparts listed above (plus duplicate wave 1 `.js` where still present)

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 7 suites, 20 tests passed
- `pnpm build` — succeeded after `checkMultipleBlocklists` and `getSessionForApis` type fixes

### Next logical step

Wave 2 continued: `utils/db.js`, `rateLimiter.js`, `checkIfAdmin.js`, `checkOwnership.js`; then `DescriptionTag` / `DescriptionCategory` models.

---

## Contact spam validation fix (2026-06-02)

### What was built and why

The contact form called `hasRealisticContent(name, message)` but the function only accepted one argument, so **only the name was validated** and gibberish messages slipped through. Split validation into field-specific rules and validate both name and message in the server action.

### Files modified

- `utils/api/detectBotPatterns.ts` — `hasRealisticName`, `hasRealisticMessage`, `hasRealisticContactFields`; shared `hasLongSingleGibberishToken` helper; `hasRealisticContent` kept as alias to `hasRealisticMessage`
- `utils/api/detectBotPatterns.test.ts` — spam example strings + legitimate name/message cases
- `app/actions/sendContactEmail.js` — `hasRealisticContactFields(name, message)`; `detectBotPatterns` on name and message

### Problems and fixes

- **Bug:** Second argument to `hasRealisticContent` was ignored at runtime.
- **Fix:** Explicit two-field API; name allows 1–2 words without 3-word minimum; message keeps 3+ words and avg length cap.

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 7 suites, 27 tests passed
- `pnpm build` — succeeded

### TODOs

- None for this fix.

### Next logical step

Continue TS wave 2 (`utils/db.js`, remaining `utils/api/*`).

---

## Contact name validation tweak (2026-06-02)

### What was built and why

Name field no longer uses message-style heuristics (avg word length, 15-char single token). Long legitimate surnames are allowed; gibberish contact names are caught via `detectBotPatterns` (`^[A-Za-z]{19,}$` — sample spam name is 19 chars, so 20+ would not match).

### Files modified

- `utils/api/detectBotPatterns.ts` — `hasRealisticName` is non-empty only; added `^[A-Za-z]{20,}$` pattern
- `utils/api/detectBotPatterns.test.ts` — spam caught by `detectBotPatterns`; `Wojciechowski` allowed

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 7 suites, 27 tests passed

---

## detectBotPatterns scoring refactor fix (2026-06-02)

### What was built and why

Scoring threshold (≥3) left the 19+ letter gibberish rule at score 2, so contact spam no longer reached the threshold. Raised gibberish rule to score 3. Removed CJK/Cyrillic rules (legitimate non-English messages). Added tests for lone URL and Chinese text.

### Files modified

- `utils/api/detectBotPatterns.ts`
- `utils/api/detectBotPatterns.test.ts`

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — detectBotPatterns suite, 14 tests passed

---

## TypeScript migration wave 2 continued (2026-06-02)

### What was built and why

Continued incremental TS conversion for high-traffic API utilities, DB connect helper, and description models. Added tests for `rateLimiter` (contact form dependency). Fixed `checkOwnership` to avoid reading `session.user` when unauthenticated.

### Files created

- `utils/api/rateLimiter.ts`, `utils/api/rateLimiter.test.ts`
- `utils/api/checkIfAdmin.ts`, `utils/api/checkOwnership.ts`
- `utils/api/getPaginatedNotifications.ts`
- `utils/db.ts`
- `models/DescriptionTag.ts`, `models/DescriptionCategory.ts`

### Files removed

- `utils/api/rateLimiter.js`, `checkIfAdmin.js`, `checkOwnership.js`, `getPaginatedNotifications.js`
- `utils/db.js`
- `models/DescriptionTag.js`, `models/DescriptionCategory.js`

### Files modified

- `app/api/names/swr/route.js` — `@utils/db.js` → `@utils/db`

### Problems and fixes

- **Build:** `mongoose.connect` deprecated options removed (`useNewUrlParser` / `useUnifiedTopology` not in Mongoose 6 types).
- **Build:** NextAuth default `User` type lacks `role`/`status` — narrow with `AppUser` cast in admin/ownership checks.
- **Bug:** `checkOwnership` used `session.user` before verifying `getSessionForApis` ok.

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 8 suites, 34 tests passed
- `pnpm build` — succeeded

### TODOs

- `utils/api/migrateField.js` (migrations only)
- Larger models: `User`, `Name`, `Description`, etc.
- Optional: `next-auth` module augmentation for `role` / `status` on `Session.user`

### Next logical step

Convert `mongoDataCleanup.js` or start `lib/auth.js` with tests; expand `next-auth` types when touching auth.

---

## 2026-06-02 — Vercel / pnpm install fix (first production pnpm deploy)

### What was broken and why

pnpm had **never** completed a successful install on Vercel for this repo. Production builds failed at `pnpm install` (exit 1), not at `next build`.

Root cause: **`package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` disagreed on pnpm config.**

- `package.json` declared `pnpm.overrides` pinning `prettier` to `2.8.4` and `@types/bcryptjs` to `2.4.6`.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` had **no** matching `settings.overrides` (lockfile was generated without those overrides).
- Lockfile importers used caret specifiers (e.g. `prettier: ^2.8.4` → resolved `2.8.8`).

Vercel reported `ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH` because pnpm requires lockfile `settings` to match `package.json` `pnpm` fields exactly.

Contributing cleanup from the same migration window:

- Stray `package-lock.json` (npm) could confuse tooling — removed in `8ea3dfa`.
- Empty `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (not a monorepo) — removed in `b3879ed`.

### How we fixed it

1. **Removed `pnpm.overrides`** from `package.json` so devDependencies use normal caret ranges (`^2.8.4`, `^2.4.6`) aligned with the lockfile.
2. **Synced `pnpm-lock.yaml`** — no `settings.overrides`; importers match `package.json` specifiers.
3. **Pinned package manager** — added `packageManager: pnpm@9.15.9` so Vercel uses the same pnpm major as CI/local frozen installs (not pnpm 11 from a global install).
4. **Added `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies`** for `core-js`, `esbuild`, `sharp`, `unrs-resolver` so native/postinstall scripts are allowed under pnpm’s build-script policy.

### Files modified

- `package.json` — removed overrides; added `onlyBuiltDependencies` and `packageManager`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` — aligned with `package.json` (no override settings)

### Verification

```bash
CI=true npx pnpm@9.15.9 install --frozen-lockfile
```

Commit: `2eee3cd` — `bug: pnpm mismatch build bug`

### TODOs

- Confirm first green Vercel deploy after push (install + `next build`).
- Do **not** re-add `pnpm.overrides` without regenerating the lockfile so `settings.overrides` matches.

### Next logical step

Push to `main`, watch Vercel install logs, then run `npx pnpm@9.15.9 build` locally if build was not verified in the same session.

## 2026-06-06 — TypeScript migration: `mongoDataCleanup`

### What was built and why

Converted `utils/mongoDataCleanup.js` to TypeScript — shared helper used across pages and API routes to run `.lean()` queries and stringify ObjectIds / strip `__v`. Added unit tests with mocked queries (no DB).

### Files created

- `utils/mongoDataCleanup.ts` — `leanWithStrings`, exported `MongoCleanupResult<T>` utility type
- `utils/mongoDataCleanup.test.ts` — 4 tests (null result, single doc, array, nested ObjectIds + Date)

### Files removed

- `utils/mongoDataCleanup.js`

### Files modified

- `jest.setup.ts` — `TextEncoder` / `TextDecoder` polyfill (required when Jest loads mongoose/mongodb)

### Patterns followed

- Same recursive transform logic as the JS original; `LeanQuery` union accepts real Mongoose queries and test mocks
- Extensionless imports unchanged (`@/utils/mongoDataCleanup`, `../mongoDataCleanup`)

### Problems and fixes

- **Jest:** Importing mongoose triggered `TextEncoder is not defined` — fixed via `util` polyfill in `jest.setup.ts`
- **Build:** Mongoose `lean().exec()` return type did not align with `MongoCleanupResult<TReturn>` — explicit casts on return paths (pragmatic, same as other migration files)

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 9 suites, 38 tests passed
- `pnpm build` — succeeded

### TODOs

- Larger models still JS: `User`, `Name`, `Description`, etc.
- `utils/api/migrateField.js` (migrations only)
- Optional: `next-auth` module augmentation for `role` / `status`

### Next logical step

Convert `lib/auth.js` with tests and expand NextAuth session types when touching auth.

### Follow-up (inline comments)

Added comments in `mongoDataCleanup.ts`, `mongoDataCleanup.test.ts`, and `jest.setup.ts` explaining lean/exec flow, transform rules, test mocks, and the TextEncoder polyfill. Test file uses `@jest-environment node` to avoid mongoose/jsdom warnings.

### Follow-up (manual test checklist)

Added **Manual verification (TypeScript migration)** section to `TESTING.md` — copy-paste checklist for post-migration smoke testing in the running app.

## 2026-06-06 — Extract code notes to `docs/notes/`

### What was built and why

Moved heavy learning/design comments out of source files into central markdown so `utils/` stays clean. Each source file keeps a one-line pointer at the top.

### Files created

- `docs/README.md` — conventions and index
- `docs/notes/utils/mongoDataCleanup.md` — design notes from `mongoDataCleanup.ts`
- `docs/notes/jest-setup.md` — TextEncoder polyfill notes from `jest.setup.ts`

### Files modified

- `utils/mongoDataCleanup.ts` — trimmed to slim JSDoc + pointer to notes
- `jest.setup.ts` — trimmed + pointer to notes
- `TESTING.md` — link to `docs/notes/` under "Where tests live"

### Next logical step

Use the same pattern for future TS conversions (`lib/auth.js`, etc.): notes in `docs/notes/<path>/<module>.md`, pointer in source.

---

## 2026-06-06 — TypeScript migration: `lib/auth`

### What was built and why

Converted `lib/auth.js` to TypeScript with NextAuth module augmentation. Extracted `resolveSignInCallback` for unit tests. Moved all original inline comments to `docs/notes/lib/auth.md` (not deleted).

### Files created

- `lib/auth.ts` — `serverAuthOptions`, `toCredentialsUser` / `toTokenUser`
- `lib/resolveSignInCallback.ts` — pure signIn branching (re-exported from `auth.ts`)
- `lib/resolveSignInCallback.test.ts` — 4 tests for sign-in branching
- `types/next-auth.d.ts` — `Session.user`, `User`, `JWT` augmentation (`id`, `role`, `status`, profile fields)
- `docs/notes/lib/auth.md` — full notes from original `auth.js`

### Files removed

- `lib/auth.js`

### Files modified

- `utils/api/checkIfAdmin.ts`, `checkOwnership.ts` — removed `AppUser` casts (types from augmentation)
- `utils/api/getSessionForApis.ts` — removed `AuthOptions` cast
- `docs/README.md` — index entry for auth notes

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — includes `lib/resolveSignInCallback.test.ts`
- `pnpm build` — succeeded
- Manual: login (credentials + magic link), protected routes, admin guard

### Next logical step

Medium utils still JS: `getUserByProfileName.js`, `findNormalizedMatch.js`, `startCooldown.js`, `filevalidation.js`.

---

## 2026-06-06 — Type `User` model; tighten `lib/auth` types

### What was built and why

Replaced loose `as string` casts in `lib/auth.ts` by converting `models/User.js` → `User.ts` with `UserStatus`, `UserRole`, and `IUserDocument`. NextAuth augmentation now uses those unions.

### Files created

- `models/User.ts`

### Files removed

- `models/User.js`

### Files modified

- `lib/auth.ts` — `toCredentialsUser` / `toTokenUser` helpers; no field casts
- `types/next-auth.d.ts` — `role` / `status` use `UserRole` / `UserStatus`

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — clean
- `pnpm test` / `pnpm build` — run before merge

---

## 2026-06-06 — Auth docs / CHANGES housekeeping

### What was changed and why

Corrected stale references after auth TS migration: test file is `lib/resolveSignInCallback.test.ts`; JWT/credentials notes now describe `toTokenUser` / `toCredentialsUser` and required `user.id`.

### Files modified

- `CHANGES.md` — auth entry test file names
- `docs/notes/lib/auth.md` — JWT, credentials, related files sections synced with [`lib/auth.ts`](lib/auth.ts)

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript migration wave 3 (utils batch)

### What was built and why

Converted the next three medium leaf utils from CHANGES “wave 3” plan: profile lookup, pagination cooldown timer, and normalized content duplicate queries. Added tests for `findNormalizedMatch` and `startCooldown`; moved long regex/index notes to `docs/notes/`.

### Files created

- `utils/getUserByProfileName.ts`
- `utils/startCooldown.ts`
- `utils/stringManipulation/findNormalizedMatch.ts`
- `utils/stringManipulation/findNormalizedMatch.test.ts`
- `utils/startCooldown.test.ts`
- `docs/notes/utils/stringManipulation/findNormalizedMatch.md`

### Files removed

- `utils/getUserByProfileName.js`
- `utils/startCooldown.js`
- `utils/stringManipulation/findNormalizedMatch.js`

### Files modified

- `docs/README.md` — index entry for findNormalizedMatch notes

### Patterns followed

- `Model<T extends NormalizedContentFields>` for Mongoose query helpers (same pragmatic cast style as `mongoDataCleanup.ts`)
- `IUserDocument | null` return on profile lookup (typed `User.ts` consumer)
- React `MutableRefObject` / `Dispatch<SetStateAction<number>>` for cooldown hook helper
- Extensionless imports unchanged for all consumers

### Problems and fixes

- **Build:** Mongoose `populate()` return type did not align with `T | null` — explicit casts on return paths (same as `mongoDataCleanup.ts`).

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 12 suites, 48 tests passed
- `pnpm build` — succeeded

### TODOs

- `lib/checkBlocklist.js` — next util (already consumed by typed `checkMultipleBlocklists.ts`)
- `utils/filevalidation.js` — appears unused; convert or remove when touching uploads
- Small models: `NameLike`, `DescriptionLike`, `Follow`, etc.

### Next logical step

Convert `lib/checkBlocklist.js` with tests and `docs/notes/lib/checkBlocklist.md`.

---

## 2026-06-07 — findNormalizedMatch docs: code examples

### What was changed and why

Expanded `docs/notes/utils/stringManipulation/findNormalizedMatch.md` with implementation snippets from `findNormalizedMatch.ts` and real call-site examples from names/description API routes.

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/utils/stringManipulation/findNormalizedMatch.md`

### Next logical step

Convert `lib/checkBlocklist.js` with tests and `docs/notes/lib/checkBlocklist.md`.

---

## 2026-06-07 — findNormalizedMatch docs: overview at top

### What was changed and why

Moved “which function to use” and a route-level usage map to the top of `findNormalizedMatch.md` so readers get context (submit vs live check vs substring) before implementation detail.

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/utils/stringManipulation/findNormalizedMatch.md`

---

## 2026-06-07 — TESTING.md: manual checks for auth + wave 3 commits

### What was changed and why

Added a “Recent commits” manual verification section to `TESTING.md` for `b1f0994` (auth/User TS) and `b29c9e7` (utils wave 3) with route-level smoke steps and regression signals.

### Files modified

- `TESTING.md` — new subsection under manual verification; fixed `lib/auth.js` → `lib/auth.ts` in convert-then-test note

---

## 2026-06-07 — TESTING.md: quick-pass checklists for recent commits

### What was changed and why

Replaced detailed tables with checkbox quick-pass lists for `b1f0994` and `b29c9e7` so manual verification can be ticked off action-by-action.

### Files modified

- `TESTING.md`

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript migration: `lib/checkBlocklist`

### What was built and why

Converted `lib/checkBlocklist.js` to TypeScript with exported `BlocklistResult` / `BlocklistType`. Added unit tests for the three-pass rules (everywhere, exact-name, substring Trie). Moved Trie design notes to `docs/notes/lib/checkBlocklist.md`.

### Files created

- `lib/checkBlocklist.ts`
- `lib/checkBlocklist.test.ts`
- `docs/notes/lib/checkBlocklist.md`

### Files removed

- `lib/checkBlocklist.js`

### Files modified

- `utils/api/checkMultipleBlocklists.ts` — `blockType` uses `BlocklistType`
- `docs/README.md` — index entry for checkBlocklist notes

### Patterns followed

- Slim source + pointer to `docs/notes/` (same as `mongoDataCleanup`, `auth`)
- Blocklist Sets built from lowercased list entries so matching aligns with normalized input
- Co-located `BlocklistResult` type for `checkMultipleBlocklists` consumer

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 13 suites, 56 tests passed
- `pnpm build` — succeeded

### TODOs

- Small models: `NameLike`, `DescriptionLike`, `Follow`, `Thank`, `Suggestion`, `Report`
- `data/blockList.js` — optional TS conversion when touching blocklist data
- `utils/filevalidation.js` — unused; delete or wire up later

### Next logical step

Convert small models batch (`Follow`, `NameLike`, `DescriptionLike`) following `NameTag.ts` pattern.

---

## 2026-06-07 — checkBlocklist docs: restore original comments

### What was changed and why

Expanded `docs/notes/lib/checkBlocklist.md` with Trie walkthrough, pass-by-pass rules, and design comments from original `checkBlocklist.js`.

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/lib/checkBlocklist.md`

---

## 2026-06-07 — checkBlocklist docs: annotated source

### What was changed and why

Added full annotated `checkBlocklist.ts` source with original inline comments to `docs/notes/lib/checkBlocklist.md`.

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/lib/checkBlocklist.md`

---

## 2026-06-07 — Move `migrateField` into `migrations/utils/`

### What was changed and why

`migrateField` is only used by migration scripts, not runtime app code. Moved from `utils/api/` to `migrations/utils/` so `utils/api` stays app-facing.

### Files created

- `migrations/utils/migrateField.js`

### Files removed

- `utils/api/migrateField.js`

### Files modified

- `migrations/toCamelCase.js` — import `./utils/migrateField.js`

### Next logical step

Convert small models batch (`Follow`, `NameLike`, `DescriptionLike`) following `NameTag.ts` pattern.

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript migration: small models (likes + follow)

### What was built and why

Converted `NameLike`, `DescriptionLike`, and `Follow` to TypeScript following `NameTag.ts` / `User.ts` patterns. Preserved explicit collection names for migration scripts. Moved index learning notes to `docs/notes/models/likes-and-follows.md`.

### Files created

- `models/NameLike.ts`
- `models/DescriptionLike.ts`
- `models/Follow.ts`
- `docs/notes/models/likes-and-follows.md`

### Files removed

- `models/NameLike.js`
- `models/DescriptionLike.js`
- `models/Follow.js`

### Files modified

- `docs/README.md` — index entry for likes-and-follows notes

### Patterns followed

- `I*Document` interfaces + `Model<I*Document>` export
- Explicit collection names (`namelikes`, `descriptionlikes`, `follows`) unchanged
- Extensionless `@/models/*` imports unchanged for app consumers

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 13 suites, 56 tests passed
- `pnpm build` — succeeded

### TODOs

- Remaining models: `Thank`, `Suggestion`, `Report`, `Name`, `Description`

### Next logical step

Convert `Thank`, `Suggestion`, `Report`; then core `Name` / `Description` models.

---

## 2026-06-07 — likes-and-follows docs: annotated source + examples

### What was changed and why

Expanded `docs/notes/models/likes-and-follows.md` with original index comments, field overview, route usage map, and annotated source snippets for all three models.

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/models/likes-and-follows.md`

---

## 2026-06-07 — TESTING.md: manual checks for checkBlocklist + likes models

### What was changed and why

Added checkbox quick-pass sections for `lib/checkBlocklist` and `NameLike` / `DescriptionLike` manual verification under Manual verification (TypeScript migration).

### Files modified

- `TESTING.md`

---

## 2026-06-07 — TESTING.md: chronological manual verification order

### What was changed and why

Reorganized manual verification checklists oldest migration → newest (wave 1 through likes models); merged regression signals into one table at the end.

### Files modified

- `TESTING.md`

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript migration: Thank, Suggestion, Report

### What was built and why

Converted remaining small moderation/thanks models before core `Name` / `Description`. Preserved `fieldDescriptions` statics on Suggestion/Report and explicit `thanks` collection name.

### Files created

- `models/Thank.ts`
- `models/Suggestion.ts`
- `models/Report.ts`
- `docs/notes/models/moderation-and-thanks.md`

### Files removed

- `models/Thank.js`
- `models/Suggestion.js`
- `models/Report.js`

### Files modified

- `docs/README.md` — index entry for moderation-and-thanks notes

### Patterns followed

- `as const` status/outcome/priority unions (same as `User.ts`)
- `ISuggestionModel` / `IReportModel` for `fieldDescriptions` static typing
- Extensionless `@/models/*` imports unchanged

### Problems and fixes

- **Build:** Mongoose `schema.statics` direct assignment failed type-check — moved `fieldDescriptions` into schema `{ statics: { ... } }` option.
- **Thank `descriptionId` required:** kept legacy `(contentType as string) === "description"` to match existing API (enum is `"descriptions"`).

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 13 suites, 56 tests passed
- `pnpm build` — succeeded

### Files modified (follow-up)

- `TESTING.md` — §11 manual checks for Thank / Suggestion / Report

### TODOs

- Core models: `Name.js`, `Description.js`

### Next logical step

Convert `Name` and `Description` models.

## 2026-06-07 — TESTING.md: restore checkbox progress after reorder

### What was changed and why

Chronological reorder reset §2 (formerly “Quick pass”) from `[x]` back to `[ ]`. Restored eight checked items from git history; added note to preserve checkbox state on future edits.

### Files modified

- `TESTING.md`

---

## 2026-06-07 — contact form: allow Japanese/CJK messages

### What was built and why

`hasRealisticMessage` required 3+ whitespace-separated words — Japanese (and much Chinese) is written without spaces, so legitimate contact submissions failed with “Please enter a valid message.”

### Files modified

- `utils/api/detectBotPatterns.ts` — `isPrimarilyChineseJapaneseKorean` path; Latin-only long single-token check
- `utils/api/detectBotPatterns.test.ts` — Japanese + Chinese message cases

### Problems and fixes

- **Root cause:** English word-count / avg-length heuristics applied to unsegmented Chinese/Japanese/Korean text.
- **Fix:** If ≥50% C/J/K characters (hiragana, katakana, hanzi, hangul), require minimum length only; keep Latin gibberish rules for spam tokens.

### Verification

- `pnpm test -- detectBotPatterns` — 17 tests passed

### Next logical step

Re-test §4 “Non-English message” on `/contact`.

---

## 2026-06-07 — contact form: non-Latin messages (Russian, Thai, etc.)

### What was changed and why

C/J/K-only bypass was too narrow. Refactored to `isPrimarilyLatin`: word-count heuristics apply only when ≥50% of letters are Latin; all other scripts (Cyrillic, Arabic, CJK, Thai, …) need minimum length only.

### Files modified

- `utils/api/detectBotPatterns.ts`
- `utils/api/detectBotPatterns.test.ts` — Russian + Thai cases

### Verification

- `pnpm test -- detectBotPatterns` — all tests passed

---

## 2026-06-07 — contact form: English and Spanish only

### What was built and why

Simplified contact policy for U.S. shelter focus: messages must use Latin script (English or Spanish). Non-Latin text is rejected with an explicit error; form shows the rule before submit.

### Files modified

- `utils/api/detectBotPatterns.ts` — `isEnglishOrSpanishScript`, `CONTACT_MESSAGE_LANGUAGE_ERROR`
- `utils/api/detectBotPatterns.test.ts`
- `app/actions/sendContactEmail.js` — language check before bot heuristics
- `components/Contact/ContactForm.jsx` — helper text under message field
- `TESTING.md` — §4 Spanish allowed / other languages rejected

### Note

Enforcement is by script (Latin letters + Spanish accents), not ML language detection — other Latin languages may pass; CJK, Cyrillic, Arabic, Thai, etc. are blocked.

### Verification

- `pnpm test -- detectBotPatterns`

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript migration: Name and Description (final models)

### What was built and why

Converted the last two Mongoose models — all `models/*` are now TypeScript. Preserved `uniqueValidator` on Name, explicit `names` collection, Description optional `createdBy`.

### Files created

- `models/Name.ts`
- `models/Description.ts`
- `docs/notes/models/name-and-description.md`

### Files removed

- `models/Name.js`
- `models/Description.js`

### Files modified

- `docs/README.md` — index entry
- `TESTING.md` — §12 core content models
- `app/api/names/swr/route.js` — `@models/Name.js` → `@models/Name` (build fix)

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 13 suites, 60 tests passed
- `pnpm build` — succeeded

### TODOs

- Migration scripts still import `../models/Name.js` / `Description.js` — update paths if re-run with Node

### Next logical step

Model migration complete; convert high-traffic API routes or `sendContactEmail.js` next.

---

## 2026-06-08 — TypeScript migration: sendContactEmail server action

### What was built and why

Converted the contact form server action to TypeScript with exported `ContactEmailState` for `useActionState` typing. Preserved validation order (honeypot → timing → language → bots → captcha → rate limit → Resend).

### Files created

- `app/actions/sendContactEmail.ts`
- `docs/notes/app/actions/sendContactEmail.md`

### Files removed

- `app/actions/sendContactEmail.js`

### Files modified

- `docs/README.md` — index entry

### Patterns followed

- `getFormString` helper for `FormData` entries
- `RecaptchaVerifyResponse` interface for siteverify JSON
- Guard on missing `RESEND_EMAIL_FROM` / `RESEND_FROM_GMAIL` for strict null checks

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 13 suites, 60 tests passed
- `pnpm build` — succeeded

### Next logical step

Convert `app/api/names/route.js` or `ContactForm.jsx` to TypeScript.

---

## 2026-06-08 — sendContactEmail.ts: restore inline comments

### What was changed and why

Re-added section headers and at-a-glance comments from the original `.js` file after TS conversion stripped them.

### Files modified

- `app/actions/sendContactEmail.ts`

---

## 2026-06-08 — TypeScript migration: `app/api/names/route.ts` (first API route)

### What was built and why

Converted the main names CRUD route to TypeScript — first `app/api/*` route in the migration. Typed request bodies; narrowed `getSessionForApis` union; legacy commented Pages-router block moved to notes.

### Files created

- `app/api/names/route.ts`
- `docs/notes/app/api/names-route.md`

### Files removed

- `app/api/names/route.js`

### Files modified

- `docs/README.md` — index entry

### Patterns followed

- `Request` handler signatures; JSON body interfaces per method
- Extensionless `@models/Name`, `@utils/db` imports
- `auth.ok` guard before `auth.session` (discriminated union)
- `new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(contentId)` for DELETE (TS requires `new`)

### Problems and fixes

- **Build:** destructuring `session` before `ok` check failed strict union — use `auth` variable + narrow first.
- **Build:** `tags` assignment needed cast to `ObjectId[]`.

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 13 suites, 60 tests passed
- `pnpm build` — succeeded

### TODOs

- Remaining names routes: `swr`, `check-if-content-exists`, likes

### Next logical step

Convert `app/api/description/route.js` (mirror of names) or `ContactForm.jsx` to TypeScript.

---

## 2026-06-08 — names route PUT: fix blocklist condition (`||` not `|`)

### What was changed and why

PUT blocklist guard used bitwise `content | notes` (copy-paste error from legacy JS). Restored logical `content || notes` so blocklist runs when either field is present.

### Files modified

- `app/api/names/route.ts`
- `docs/notes/app/api/names-route.md` — removed obsolete legacy note

---

## 2026-06-08 — TypeScript migration: `app/api/description/route.ts`

### What was built and why

Converted descriptions CRUD route to TypeScript, mirroring `names/route.ts`. Typed helpers (`checkDuplicateDescription`, `returnExistingMessage`) and request bodies; preserved `new Response("Unauthorized")` and `{ error: err.message }` response shapes from the JS version.

### Files created

- `app/api/description/route.ts`
- `docs/notes/app/api/description-route.md`

### Files removed

- `app/api/description/route.js`

### Files modified

- `docs/README.md` — index entry

### Patterns followed

- Same as names route: `auth.ok` narrowing, `notes ?? ""` for blocklist, `new mongoose.Types.ObjectId` for DELETE lookup
- `IDescriptionDocument` for duplicate-check return typing
- Optional `createdBy` on model — non-null assertions where legacy route assumed doc exists

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 13 suites, 60 tests passed
- `pnpm build` — succeeded

### Next logical step

Convert `ContactForm.jsx` to TypeScript, or smaller API routes (`names/swr`, `description/swr`, check-if-content-exists).

---

## 2026-06-08 — Unit tests for recent migrations (extract + test pure logic)

### What was built and why

Recent route/action migrations were manual-only. Followed existing pattern (`resolveSignInCallback`, `detectBotPatterns`): extract pure validation into `utils/api/*`, add Jest suites. Full handler tests still need DB/auth mocks — not added.

### Files created

- `utils/api/validateContactSubmission.ts` + `.test.ts` — honeypot, timing, required fields, email, lengths, reCAPTCHA
- `utils/api/descriptionDuplicateCheck.ts` + `.test.ts` — duplicate guard decision + 409 payload
- `utils/stringManipulation/check-for-valid-content.test.ts` — name character rules (used by names route)

### Files modified

- `app/actions/sendContactEmail.ts` — uses `validateContactSubmission`
- `app/api/description/route.ts` — uses `descriptionDuplicateCheck`
- `docs/notes/app/actions/sendContactEmail.md`, `docs/notes/app/api/description-route.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 16 suites, 85 tests passed (+25)

### Still manual / not unit-tested

- Names/description route handlers (Mongoose + `getSessionForApis` mocks)
- Resend email send path
- Model schemas (Mongoose integration)
- `e2e/login.spec.ts` remains the only Playwright flow test

---

## 2026-06-08 — Names validation extract + Playwright `/addnames` and `/contact`

### What was built and why

Extracted names-route validation into unit-tested helpers. Added Playwright specs for contact (timing, language) and addnames (logged-out gate + optional authenticated submit). E2E contact tests use env-gated reCAPTCHA bypass (`E2E_TEST_MODE` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E_TEST_MODE`) only when Playwright starts the server.

### Files created

- `utils/api/validateNameSubmission.ts` + `.test.ts`
- `e2e/addnames.spec.ts`, `e2e/contact.spec.ts`, `e2e/helpers/auth.ts`

### Files modified

- `app/api/names/route.ts` — uses `validateNameSubmission`
- `app/actions/sendContactEmail.ts`, `components/Contact/ContactForm.jsx` — E2E bypass
- `playwright.config.ts` — E2E env on `webServer`
- `docs/notes/app/api/names-route.md`, `TESTING.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 17 suites, 92 tests passed
- `pnpm test:e2e:local` — 6 passed, 2 skipped (no `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_*` creds)

### E2E follow-up fixes (freeze + selectors)

- Contact Submit was disabled up to 10s while reCAPTCHA loaded — tests timed out waiting; E2E build now skips that gate
- `pnpm test:e2e` can hang if port 3000 is busy during `build && start` — added `pnpm test:e2e:local` + `scripts/playwright-local.mjs`
- Fixed contact selectors (`input[name=…]`), login strict-mode Register link, addnames logged-out test

---

## 2026-06-08 — E2E: MONGODB_URI_TEST + NextAuth notes

### What was changed and why

Playwright `webServer` now sets `MONGODB_URI` from `MONGODB_URI_TEST` so E2E hits an isolated DB while dev keeps `MONGODB_URI`. Added `pnpm build:e2e` / `pnpm start:e2e` for local E2E server; documented that NextAuth uses the same swapped URI (seed test user once via `/register`).

### Files modified

- `playwright.config.ts`, `package.json`, `scripts/build-e2e.mjs`, `scripts/start-e2e.mjs`, `TESTING.md`

---

## 2026-06-08 — E2E: register reCAPTCHA bypass for test DB seeding

### What was changed and why

`/register` required reCAPTCHA, which fails on localhost. Added same E2E bypass as contact (`e2e-bypass` token when `E2E_TEST_MODE` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E_TEST_MODE` set at build/start).

### Files created

- `utils/api/e2eTestMode.ts`

### Files modified

- `app/api/auth/signup/route.js`, `components/Register/RegisterForm.jsx`
- `components/Contact/ContactForm.jsx`, `app/actions/sendContactEmail.ts` — use shared helper
- `TESTING.md`

---

## 2026-06-08 — `pnpm seed:e2e-user` CLI for test DB

### What was built and why

Browser register + captcha blocked seeding the Playwright user. Script inserts/updates credentials user directly in `MONGODB_URI_TEST` from env vars.

### Files created

- `scripts/seed-e2e-user.mjs`

### Files modified

- `package.json` — `seed:e2e-user` script
- `TESTING.md`

---

## 2026-06-08 — Expand E2E + TESTING.md E2E vs manual matrix

### What was built and why

Added Playwright coverage for manual checks that automate cleanly (contact spam/language/rate limit, login auth, addnames duplicate/blocklist, browse load). Documented which § items E2E replaces vs still manual.

### Files created

- `e2e/browse.spec.ts`, `e2e/helpers/contact.ts`

### Files modified

- `e2e/contact.spec.ts`, `e2e/login.spec.ts`, `e2e/addnames.spec.ts`
- `app/actions/sendContactEmail.ts` — rate limit before E2E email skip
- `TESTING.md`, `docs/notes/app/actions/sendContactEmail.md`

---

## 2026-06-08 — TESTING.md: E2E owns automated flows; manual = captcha/email/gaps

### What was changed and why

Removed manual checklist items now covered by Playwright. Manual section reorganized by what E2E cannot test (captcha, Resend, magic link, multi-user, admin, content depth, Network inspection).

### Files modified

- `TESTING.md`

---

## 2026-06-08 — TypeScript migration: `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`

### What was built and why

Converted signup API to TypeScript; extracted pure field validation to `validateSignupSubmission` (unit tested). Uses shared `isE2eCaptchaBypass`; removed dead `createSecretKey` import from legacy JS.

### Files created

- `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`
- `utils/api/validateSignupSubmission.ts`, `validateSignupSubmission.test.ts`
- `docs/notes/app/api/signup-route.md`

### Files modified

- `docs/README.md`

### Files removed

- `app/api/auth/signup/route.js`

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — 98 passed
- `pnpm build` — OK

### Next logical step

Convert `app/api/names/swr/route.js` or `RegisterForm.jsx` to TypeScript.

---

## 2026-06-08 — Restore `.gitattributes` (LF line endings)

### What was changed and why

Re-added repo-level line-ending rules so Git stops warning about LF/CRLF on Windows. Text files use LF; common binary extensions are excluded.

### Files created

- `.gitattributes`

### Next logical step

After pulling this file, run `git add --renormalize .` once if old CRLF files still warn, then recommit.

---

## 2026-06-08 — Follow API: use `Follow` model (not `User.followers`)

### What was changed and why

Followers live in the `follows` collection (`models/Follow.ts`), not on `User`. Reverted mistaken `followers` field on `User`. `updatefollows` now upserts/deletes `Follow` docs; profile and `getASpecificUserByProfileName` load followers via `getUserFollowers`.

### Files created

- `utils/api/getUserFollowers.ts`

### Files modified

- `app/api/user/updatefollows/route.js`
- `app/api/user/getASpecificUserByProfileName/[name]/route.js`
- `app/profile/[profilename]/page.jsx`
- `models/User.ts` (reverted `followers`)
- `scripts/seed-e2e.mjs`, `docs/notes/models/likes-and-follows.md`

---

## 2026-06-08 — E2E: admin, edits, social specs

### What was built and why

Added Playwright coverage for admin access, ownership edits, and social flows using seeded user + admin. Extended fixtures with admin-owned name/description.

### Files created

- `e2e/admin.spec.ts`, `e2e/edits.spec.ts`, `e2e/social.spec.ts`
- `e2e/helpers/seed-lookup.ts`, `e2e/helpers/likes.ts`

### Files modified

- `e2e/fixtures/seed-data.json`, `seed-data.ts`, `scripts/seed-e2e.mjs`
- `TESTING.md`

---

## 2026-06-08 — E2E shared seed fixtures (name, descriptions, admin)

### What was built and why

Single source of truth for seeded test DB content: `e2e/fixtures/seed-data.json` is read by `pnpm seed:e2e` and Playwright tests via `seed-data.ts`. Duplicate name/description specs no longer create-then-duplicate at runtime.

### Files created

- `e2e/fixtures/seed-data.json`, `e2e/fixtures/seed-data.ts`
- `scripts/seed-e2e.mjs`

### Files modified

- `e2e/addnames.spec.ts`, `e2e/adddescriptions.spec.ts`
- `e2e/helpers/auth.ts` — `loginWithAdminCredentials`
- `e2e/helpers/register.ts` — profile name from fixture module
- `package.json`, `TESTING.md`

### Files removed

- `scripts/seed-e2e-user.mjs` (replaced by `seed-e2e.mjs`; `seed:e2e-user` script kept as alias)

### Next logical step

Add admin/ownership E2E using `loginWithAdminCredentials` and seeded admin user.

---

## 2026-06-08 — E2E: move more manual checks (auth, descriptions, blocklist, API shape)

### What was built and why

Reviewed remaining manual verification items and automated flows that do not need captcha, Resend, or a second user: session/dashboard/notifications/profile, sign-out round-trip, description create/detail, duplicate “check if exists” (start vs middle), name/detail page, `fluffy butt` negative blocklist case, editsettings validation, duplicate register email, and names SWR `_id` string shape.

### Files created

- `e2e/auth-session.spec.ts`
- `e2e/adddescriptions.spec.ts`
- `e2e/editsettings.spec.ts`
- `e2e/helpers/descriptions.ts`

### Files modified

- `e2e/helpers/auth.ts` — `openProfileMenu`, `signOutViaNav`
- `e2e/addnames.spec.ts`, `e2e/register.spec.ts`, `e2e/browse.spec.ts`
- `TESTING.md` — E2E bullets + trimmed manual checklist

### Problems encountered

- Description form does not require tags server-side; removed flaky react-select helper.
- Nav menu items use Headless UI `menuitem` role, not `link` / `button` for Profile/Logout.
- Contact rate-limit test must run last in serial `contact.spec.ts` (Spanish + legitimate consume 2 of 3 IP slots).

### TODOs

- Social/notification flows still need a second seeded E2E user.
- Pagination/sort cooldown tests skipped (15s+ waits).
- Full register happy path + default avatar still manual (real captcha).

### Next logical step

Run `pnpm seed:e2e-user && pnpm test:e2e` and fix any flaky tag-select or aggregate `_id` assertions.

---

## 2026-06-08 — E2E: contact spam message + register duplicate profilename

### What was built and why

Gibberish contact message and duplicate `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_PROFILENAME` on register are automatable with E2E captcha bypass; removed from manual checklist.

### Files created

- `e2e/register.spec.ts`, `e2e/helpers/register.ts`

### Files modified

- `e2e/contact.spec.ts`, `TESTING.md`

---

## 2026-06-09 — TypeScript: `RegisterForm`

### What was changed and why

Converted the register form to TypeScript as part of the signup-route migration. Typed `react-hook-form` values, signup API response/errors (`SignupFieldErrors`), captcha flow, and axios error handling. Removed leftover debug `console.log` / render-side logging.

### Files created

- `components/Register/RegisterForm.tsx`
- `components/FormComponents/RegisterInput.d.ts`
- `components/Shared/actions/GeneralButton.d.ts`

### Files removed

- `components/Register/RegisterForm.jsx`

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/app/api/signup-route.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm build` — OK

### TODOs

- `checkIfNameExists` / `resetData` state helpers are still unused in the JSX (pre-existing).
- `RegisterInput.jsx` / `GeneralButton.jsx` still JS; `.d.ts` stubs only unblock TS consumers.

### Next logical step

Run `pnpm test:e2e e2e/register.spec.ts` or convert `app/api/names/swr/route.js` next.

---

## 2026-06-09 — TypeScript: `names/swr` API route

### What was changed and why

Converted paginated names SWR listing to TypeScript. Extracted pure GET/POST source parsing and sort defaults into `parseNamesSwrRequest.ts` (6 unit tests). Behavior unchanged: POST body + query merge, `_id` sort tiebreaker, 50-item pages.

### Files created

- `app/api/names/swr/route.ts`
- `utils/api/parseNamesSwrRequest.ts`, `parseNamesSwrRequest.test.ts`
- `docs/notes/app/api/names-swr-route.md`

### Files removed

- `app/api/names/swr/route.js`

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/app/api/names-route.md`, `docs/README.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm test -- parseNamesSwrRequest` — 6 passed
- `pnpm build` — OK

### Next logical step

Convert `app/api/description/swr/route.js` (similar shape) or run `pnpm test:e2e e2e/browse.spec.ts`.

---

## 2026-06-09 — TypeScript: `description/swr` API route

### What was changed and why

Converted paginated descriptions SWR listing to TypeScript. Reused `parseNamesSwrRequest.ts` with description-specific helpers (`buildSwrFilterSourceFromSearchParams`, `parseSwrPaginationFromSearchParams`). Preserved original behavior: page/sort always from URL; filters from POST body or query `getAll`. Kept PUT/DELETE 405.

### Files created

- `app/api/description/swr/route.ts`
- `docs/notes/app/api/description-swr-route.md`

### Files removed

- `app/api/description/swr/route.js`

### Files modified

- `utils/api/parseNamesSwrRequest.ts`, `parseNamesSwrRequest.test.ts` (3 new tests, 9 total)
- `docs/notes/app/api/description-route.md`, `docs/README.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm test -- parseNamesSwrRequest` — 9 passed
- `pnpm build` — OK

### Next logical step

Run `pnpm test:e2e e2e/browse.spec.ts` or convert smaller API routes (`check-if-content-exists`, `grabusersfollowing`).

---

## 2026-06-09 — Restore original inline comments on SWR routes

### What was changed and why

Re-added explanatory comments from the original `route.js` files into `names/swr/route.ts`, `description/swr/route.ts`, and `parseNamesSwrRequest.ts` (POST/GET merge, likedIds Case 1/2, filter build, aggregation sections, handler docs).

### Files modified

- `app/api/names/swr/route.ts`
- `app/api/description/swr/route.ts`
- `utils/api/parseNamesSwrRequest.ts`

---

## 2026-06-09 — VS Code: save files with LF line endings

### What was changed and why

Added `"files.eol": "\n"` to workspace settings so Cursor/VS Code saves new edits as LF on Windows, matching `.gitattributes` and reducing CRLF warnings on `git add`.

### Files modified

- `.vscode/settings.json`

### Next logical step

Re-save or convert any files still showing `w/crlf` (`git ls-files --eol | rg w/crlf`), then run `git add` again.

---

## 2026-06-09 — One-time CRLF → LF working-tree normalize

### What was changed and why

`files.eol` only affects new saves; 344 tracked files still had CRLF on disk (`w/crlf`). Converted working copies to LF and added `.editorconfig` so editors respect LF alongside `.gitattributes`.

### Files created

- `.editorconfig`

### Verification

- `git ls-files --eol | rg w/crlf` — 0 matches
- `git add .` — no CRLF warnings

---

## 2026-06-09 — TypeScript: `check-if-content-exists` routes

### What was changed and why

Converted live duplicate-check API routes for names and descriptions to TypeScript. Behavior unchanged: names use blocklist + invalid chars + exact normalized match; descriptions use blocklist + `findStartNormalized`. Removed unused imports (names) and debug `console.log` (descriptions).

### Files created

- `app/api/names/check-if-content-exists/[content]/route.ts`
- `app/api/description/check-if-content-exists/[content]/route.ts`
- `docs/notes/app/api/check-if-content-exists.md`

### Files removed

- `app/api/names/check-if-content-exists/[content]/route.js`
- `app/api/description/check-if-content-exists/[content]/route.js`

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/app/api/names-route.md`, `description-route.md`, `docs/README.md`
- `docs/notes/utils/stringManipulation/findNormalizedMatch.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm build` — OK

### Next logical step

Run `pnpm test:e2e e2e/adddescriptions.spec.ts` or convert `app/api/user/grabusersfollowing` (Follow model fix).

---

## 2026-06-09 — TypeScript + Follow fix: `grabusersfollowing`

### What was changed and why

`GET /api/user/grabusersfollowing/[userid]` no longer queries removed `User.followers`. Added `getUserFollowing` (reads `Follow` where `followedBy = userid`, populates `userId`). Converted route to TypeScript. Profile page commented hook updated for when following UI is re-enabled. E2E social spec asserts the API after admin follow.

### Files created

- `app/api/user/grabusersfollowing/[userid]/route.ts`
- `utils/api/getUserFollowing.ts`
- `docs/notes/app/api/grabusersfollowing-route.md`

### Files removed

- `app/api/user/grabusersfollowing/[userid]/route.js`

### Files modified

- `app/profile/[profilename]/page.jsx`
- `e2e/social.spec.ts`
- `docs/notes/models/likes-and-follows.md`, `docs/README.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm build` — OK
- `pnpm test:e2e e2e/social.spec.ts` — run with seeded test DB

### Next logical step

Convert `app/api/user/updatefollows/route.js` or `ContactForm.jsx` to TypeScript.

---

## 2026-06-09 — TypeScript: `updatefollows` API route

### What was changed and why

Converted follow toggle route to TypeScript. Behavior unchanged: session auth, upsert/delete `Follow` docs based on `userFollowed` UI flag. Uses `Response.json` (same payloads as before).

### Files created

- `app/api/user/updatefollows/route.ts`
- `docs/notes/app/api/updatefollows-route.md`

### Files removed

- `app/api/user/updatefollows/route.js`

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/app/api/grabusersfollowing-route.md`, `docs/notes/models/likes-and-follows.md`, `docs/README.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm build` — OK
- E2E: `e2e/social.spec.ts` (existing follow tests)

### Next logical step

Convert `ContactForm.jsx` or like-toggle routes (`names/likes/.../togglelike`).

---

## 2026-06-09 — TypeScript: togglelike routes (names + descriptions)

### What was changed and why

Converted both like-toggle API routes to TypeScript. Preserved transaction flow, original inline comments, and route-specific quirks (names passes `{ req }` to `getSessionForApis`; description calls it with no args; description keeps GET 405).

### Files created

## 2026-06-09 — TypeScript: `ContactForm`

### What was changed and why

Converted contact form to TypeScript. Typed `useActionState` with `ContactEmailState`, captcha flow (v3/v2/E2E bypass), and form submit handler. Renamed default export to `ContactForm` (was `ContactPage` in JSX file). Added `.d.ts` stubs for `StyledInput` / `StyledTextarea`.

### Files created

## 2026-06-09 — TypeScript: notification API routes

### What was changed and why

Converted all six notification routes (names, descriptions, thanks — each with `mark-read`). Added `parseNotificationPagination` to shared helper. Preserved `$ne` ObjectId comments on names route, thanks PATCH comments, and descriptions error strings (pre-existing copy). Removed debug `console.log` from thanks GET.

### Files created

## 2026-06-09 — Restore populate side-effect imports on notification routes

### What was changed and why

Re-added `User` / `Name` / `Description` imports on notification GET routes. They register Mongoose models so `populate()` can resolve `ref` fields — not dead code. Documented in `notifications-routes.md`.

### Files modified

- `app/api/notifications/names/route.ts`
- `app/api/notifications/descriptions/route.ts`
- `app/api/notifications/thanks/route.ts`
- `docs/notes/app/api/notifications-routes.md`

---

## 2026-06-09 — Notifications: unit + E2E tests

### What was built and why

Added notification test coverage: unit tests for `parseNotificationPagination`; E2E for 401, populate shape (guards ref model imports), description notifications, and names mark-read. Thanks notifications remain manual (no seeded thank helper).

### Files created

- `utils/api/getPaginatedNotifications.test.ts`
- `e2e/notifications.spec.ts`

### Files modified

- `e2e/helpers/likes.ts` — `ensureDescriptionLiked`
- `TESTING.md`, `docs/notes/app/api/notifications-routes.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm test -- getPaginatedNotifications` — 3 passed
- `pnpm test:e2e e2e/notifications.spec.ts` — run with seeded test DB

---

## 2026-06-09 — Audit: restore populate side-effect imports across TS conversions

### What was changed and why

Audited all `.populate()` call sites vs git history. Several TS conversions dropped ref-model imports that existed in JS (or were never added on new Follow/findNormalized helpers). Restored `// necessary for populate` imports on names/description routes, check-if-content-exists, getUserFollowers/Following, findNormalizedMatch. Documented full audit table in `notifications-routes.md`.

### Files modified

- `app/api/names/route.ts`, `app/api/description/route.ts`
- `app/api/names/check-if-content-exists/[content]/route.ts`

## 2026-06-09 — TypeScript: `app/contact/page`

### What was changed and why

### Files created

- `app/contact/page.tsx`
- `components/Shared/typography/PageTitleWithImages.d.ts`

### Files removed

### Next logical step

Convert `app/(protected)/notifications/page.jsx` or `app/api/user/likes/route.js`.

---

## 2026-06-07 — Fix `PageTitleWithImages` props on contact page

### What was changed and why

`app/contact/page.tsx` failed type-check because TypeScript inferred all destructured props (`imgSrc`, `title`, `title2`) as required from the untyped `.jsx` component, ignoring the optional `.d.ts`. Converted the component to `.tsx` with an explicit optional props type.

### Files created

- `components/Shared/typography/PageTitleWithImages.tsx`

### Files removed

- `components/Shared/typography/PageTitleWithImages.jsx`
- `components/Shared/typography/PageTitleWithImages.d.ts`

### Verification

### Next logical step

Continue TS migration (`app/(protected)/notifications/page.jsx` or remaining API routes).

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: `app/(protected)/notifications/page`

### What was changed and why

Converted the protected notifications server page to TypeScript. Kept `User` / `Name` populate side-effect imports; removed unused imports (`Description`, `Thank`, `leanWithStrings`, `MarkThanksRead`). Added `ToggleOneNotificationPage.d.ts` so optional props (`swrForThisUserID`) type-check from TS consumers.

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: `ToggleOneNotificationPage`

### What was changed and why

Converted the notifications tab client component to `.tsx` with exported prop types (`NotificationTabConfig`, `NotificationModelType`). Removed unused imports. Added `.d.ts` stubs for `useSWRSimple` and `notificationsContext` so `initialPage` and unread-count context type-check. Expanded `docs/notes/app/notifications-page.md` with SWR lazy-load and mark-read behavior. Removed the interim `ToggleOneNotificationPage.d.ts`.

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: `hooks/useSwrSimple`

### What was changed and why

Converted notification infinite-SWR hook from `.js` to `.ts`, replacing the interim `.d.ts`. Exported `NotificationModelType`, `UseSWRSimpleOptions`, and `SwrSimpleReturn` from the implementation so `ToggleOneNotificationPage` and `notificationsContext.d.ts` resolve types from the real module.

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: `app/api/user/notifications/route`

### What was changed and why

Converted unread-count API to TypeScript — completes the notifications cluster (badge API + context + UI + paginated feeds). Exported `UserNotificationsCountsResponse`. Removed unused `leanWithStrings` import; aligned `dbConnect` import with other notification routes; fixed error log message (was "suggestions").

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: `ToggeableAlert`, `addHashToArrayString`, `ThanksDialog`

### What was changed and why

Converted three small listing/UI helpers to TypeScript. `ToggeableAlert` typed `toggleState` as `boolean | string` (legacy `addingName` passes message string). `addHashToArrayString` renamed internal function to match file name. `ThanksDialog` typed props; dropped unused `contentId` / `suggestionBy` pass-through to `AddThanks` (never consumed).

## 2026-06-07 — Cleanup: remove dead `target` from `ThanksDialog`

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: thanks flow (remaining files)

### What was changed and why

Completed thanks-flow migration: data options, submission form, API routes, and mark-read helper. Removed dead commented code from thanks route.

## 2026-06-07 — Fix: canonical `descriptions` contentType

### What was changed and why

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: `app/fetchnames/page`

### What was changed and why

Converted fetch-names listing route to TypeScript. Removed dead server prefetch (`NameLikes`, session, legacy props never read by `CoreListingPageLogic`). Page now matches slim `fetchdescriptions` pattern. Dropped unused `sessionFromServer` / `usersLikedContent` from `CoreListingPageLogicProps`.

### Files created

- `app/fetchnames/page.tsx`
- `docs/notes/app/fetchnames-page.md`

### Files removed

- `app/fetchnames/page.jsx`

### Files modified

- `components/CoreListingPagesLogic.tsx`
- `docs/notes/components/core-listing-pages-logic.md`
- `docs/README.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm build` — OK

### Next logical step

Convert `app/fetchdescriptions/page.jsx`.

---

## 2026-06-07 — Add `docs/FUTURE.md` (likes prefetch plan)

### What was changed and why

Documented post–TypeScript migration backlog. First item: Option B — server-fetch likes and seed `LikesProvider` (not reviving dead `fetchnames` page props).

### Files created

- `docs/FUTURE.md`

### Files modified

- `docs/README.md`

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: `app/fetchdescriptions/page`

### What was changed and why

Converted fetch-descriptions listing route to TypeScript. Renamed default export to `FetchDescriptionsPage`. Same slim pattern as `fetchnames/page.tsx`.

### Files created

- `app/fetchdescriptions/page.tsx`
- `docs/notes/app/fetchdescriptions-page.md`

### Files removed

- `app/fetchdescriptions/page.jsx`

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/app/fetchnames-page.md`
- `docs/notes/components/core-listing-pages-logic.md`
- `docs/README.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm build` — OK

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: `app/adddescriptions/page`

### What was changed and why

Converted add-descriptions page shell to TypeScript. Server component (no page-level `useSession` — form handles auth). Renamed export to `AddDescriptionsPage`.

### Files created

- `app/adddescriptions/page.tsx`
- `docs/notes/app/adddescriptions-page.md`

### Files removed

- `app/adddescriptions/page.js`

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/components/add-content-forms.md`
- `docs/README.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm build` — OK

### Next logical step

Convert `hooks/useSwrPagination.js` or `components/ShowingListOfContent/pagination.js`.

---

## 2026-06-07 — Remove dead `DashboardChartForFavDescriptions`

### What was changed and why

Deleted unused component — nothing imported it; render body was fully commented out. Fav descriptions on the dashboard use `ToggleOneContentPage` → `CoreListingPageLogic` with `restrictSwrToLikedNames` instead.

### Files removed

- `components/ShowingListOfContent/DashboardChartForFavDescriptions.jsx`

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: listing stack (`useSwrPagination`, `pagination`, `FilteringSidebar`)

### What was changed and why

Converted the three modules that power browse/profile listing pages to TypeScript. Fixed `useLikes()` rules-of-hooks violation (now called unconditionally at hook top). Replaced filter reset `handleApplyFilters("reset")` with `handleApplyFilters(true)`. Removed unused `startCooldown` prop from `FilteringSidebar` (never used in component). Deleted `useSwrPagination.d.ts` — types live in the `.ts` hook file.

### Files created

- `hooks/useSwrPagination.ts`
- `components/ShowingListOfContent/pagination.tsx`
- `components/Filtering/FilteringSidebar.tsx`
- `docs/notes/hooks/useSwrPagination.md`
- `docs/notes/components/pagination.md`
- `docs/notes/components/filtering-sidebar.md`

### Files removed

- `hooks/useSwrPagination.js`
- `hooks/useSwrPagination.d.ts`
- `components/ShowingListOfContent/pagination.js`
- `components/Filtering/FilteringSidebar.jsx`

### Files modified

- `components/CoreListingPagesLogic.tsx` — drop dead `startCooldown` prop on filter sidebar
- `docs/notes/components/core-listing-pages-logic.md`
- `docs/notes/app/api/names-swr-route.md`, `description-swr-route.md`
- `docs/README.md`

### Patterns followed

- Export prop/params types from converted modules (`PaginationProps`, `FilteringSidebarProps`, `UseSwrPaginationParams`)
- `"use client"` on hook and pagination (hooks)
- Preserve preload/cooldown comments from original `pagination.js`

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm build` — OK

### Next logical step

Convert form primitives used by filters: `StyledCheckbox.jsx`, `StyledInput.jsx`. Then single-content pages `app/name/[name]/page.jsx`, `app/description/[id]/page.jsx`.

---

## 2026-06-07 — Docs: preserve listing-stack behavioral notes

### What was changed and why

Listing-stack `docs/notes/` files were too bare after TS migration. Expanded them with original inline comments from `useSwrPagination.js`, `pagination.js`, `FilteringSidebar.jsx`, and `CoreListingPagesLogic.jsx` (recovered via git). Added migration convention doc so future conversions move long comments into notes files.

### Files created

- `docs/notes/typescript/preserving-migration-notes.md`

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/hooks/useSwrPagination.md` — SWR infinite rationale, getKey, revalidate flags, liked-only mode
- `docs/notes/components/pagination.md` — preload overrides, filter boundary useEffect, 50/page cap, rejected fixes
- `docs/notes/components/filtering-sidebar.md` — quick-filter IDs, StyledCheckbox id bug, apply/reset flow
- `docs/notes/components/core-listing-pages-logic.md` — two-layer pagination, slice/mutate, drawer, cooldowns
- `docs/README.md` — link to preserving-migration-notes convention
- `hooks/useSwrPagination.ts`, `pagination.tsx`, `FilteringSidebar.tsx` — restored short inline comments + doc pointers

---

## 2026-06-07 — Docs: code excerpts in listing-stack notes

### What was changed and why

User should not need to switch between docs and source. Added representative code blocks (with file-path comments) to listing-stack notes; updated preserving-migration-notes convention and docs README.

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/hooks/useSwrPagination.md`
- `docs/notes/components/pagination.md`
- `docs/notes/components/filtering-sidebar.md`
- `docs/notes/components/core-listing-pages-logic.md`
- `docs/notes/typescript/preserving-migration-notes.md`
- `docs/README.md`

---

## 2026-06-07 — Restore inline comments in listing stack source

### What was changed and why

Re-added helpful inline comments stripped during TS conversion (pagination preload/UI, FilteringSidebar section labels, checkbox accessibility note on `value`, useSwrPagination getKey). Long bug history stays in docs; short pointers remain in code.

### Files modified

- `components/ShowingListOfContent/pagination.tsx`
- `components/Filtering/FilteringSidebar.tsx`
- `hooks/useSwrPagination.ts`
- `docs/notes/typescript/preserving-migration-notes.md`

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: form primitives and siblings

### What was changed and why

Converted shared form components to TypeScript with exported prop types. `StyledCheckbox.description` is optional (no empty string needed in FilteringSidebar). `RegisterInput` now honors `className` on the input (was passed from RegisterForm but ignored in JS). Preserved inline comments (checkbox id/mobile focus, StyledSelect SSR/hydration, RegisterInput helperText cases).

### Files created

- `components/FormComponents/StyledCheckbox.tsx`
- `components/FormComponents/StyledInput.tsx`
- `components/FormComponents/StyledTextarea.tsx`
- `components/FormComponents/StyledSelect.tsx`
- `components/FormComponents/RegisterInput.tsx`
- `components/FormComponents/CheckboxWithLabelAndDescription.tsx`
- `components/AddingNewData/preserveTextAfterSubmission.tsx`
- `docs/notes/components/form-components.md`

### Files removed

### Files modified

- `components/Filtering/FilteringSidebar.tsx`
- `docs/notes/components/add-content-forms.md`, `filtering-sidebar.md`
- `docs/README.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm build` — OK

### Next logical step

Convert `app/name/[name]/page.jsx` and `app/description/[id]/page.jsx`, then `app/api/categories-and-tags/route.js`.

---

## 2026-06-07 — Docs: form-components special-behavior notes

### What was changed and why

Expanded `form-components.md` with inline-comment behavior (StyledCheckbox id/mobile hiding, StyledSelect SSR/hydration, RegisterInput helperText cases). Updated preserving-migration-notes convention.

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/components/form-components.md`
- `docs/notes/typescript/preserving-migration-notes.md`

---

## 2026-06-07 — Delete unused `CheckboxWithLabelAndDescription`

### What was changed and why

Removed orphaned component — no imports anywhere. Flag report categories use `StyledCheckbox` in `AddReport.tsx`. `addingName.jsx` once imported it but never rendered it.

### Files removed

- `components/FormComponents/CheckboxWithLabelAndDescription.tsx`

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/components/form-components.md` — removed section; note `AddReport` uses `StyledCheckbox` for categories

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: single-content pages (`name/[name]`, `description/[id]`)

### What was changed and why

Converted standalone detail routes to TypeScript. Renamed exports `Postid` → `NamePage` / `DescriptionPage`. Populate-only models via `import "@/models/NameTag"` / `DescriptionTag`. Description page: `mongoose.Types.ObjectId` + `isValid` → `notFound()` instead of `require("mongodb").ObjectId`. Dropped redundant Font Awesome CSS import on description page (children import it). `leanWithStrings` result cast `as unknown as ContentListingItem` for populate typing.

### Files created

- `app/name/[name]/page.tsx`
- `app/description/[id]/page.tsx`

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: `app/api/categories-and-tags/route`

### What was changed and why

Converted categories/tags API to TypeScript. Exported `CategoriesAndTagsResponse`. Preserved `revalidate = 10800` and parallel `leanWithStrings` + populate queries. Documented relationship to layout `getCategoriesAndTagsWithTTL` cache.

### Files created

- `app/api/categories-and-tags/route.ts`

### Next logical step

Convert `app/layout.js` (still loads categories for `CategTagsWrapper`) or auth pages (`login.jsx`, `register/page.js`).

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: `app/layout`

### What was changed and why

Converted root server layout to TypeScript. Preserved metadata, 3-hour in-memory `getCategoriesAndTagsWithTTL` cache, `safeSession` normalization, provider wrapper tree, and inline layout comments. Dropped unused `LinkButton` / `Image` imports from the JS original. Typed cache with `CategoryWithTags[]` from context.

Convert auth pages (`login.jsx`, `register/page.js`, `forgotpassword.jsx`, `ResetPassword.jsx`) or `(protected)/layout.jsx`.

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: blockList + small UI / social list components

### What was changed and why

Converted seven leaf modules: profanity data (`blockList`), shared loading/login UI, landing-page YouTube embed, profile follow/follower modals, and `SingleOpenGroup` accordion helper. Typed props with `FollowingUser` / `FollowerUser` / `Session`. Removed dead imports (`Image`, unused `framer-motion` in `SingleOpenGroup`, unused React hooks in following list).

### Files created

---

## 2026-06-07 — Remove unused `SingleOpenGroup`

### What was changed and why

Deleted `SingleOpenGroup` — zero imports in the repo; accordion behavior lives in `ToggleOneContentPage` and `ToggleOneNotificationPage`.

### Files removed

- `components/ShowingListOfContent/SingleOpenGroup.tsx`

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/components/showing-list-of-content/youtube-and-social-lists.md`

### Verification

- No app imports to update; `tsc` / build not re-run (delete-only).

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: `ReusableSmallComponents/buttons`

### What was changed and why

Converted all remaining JS/JSX button primitives to `.tsx`. Merged `GeneralButton.d.ts` and `WarningMessage.d.ts` into source. Renamed `generalOpenCloseButton` → `GeneralOpenCloseButton.tsx` with generic tab typing. Removed `ComponentType` casts in `ToggleOneContentPage`, `SharingOptionsBar`, and `CoreListingPagesLogic`. Fixed `FollowButton` effect deps and sign-in guard; removed unused `ToastContainer`. Fixed stray quote in `DisabledButton` class string. Removed debug `console.log` from open/close tab button.

### Files created

### Files removed

- `components/ReusableSmallComponents/buttons/CheckForMoreDataButton.tsx`

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/components/reusable-buttons.md`

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: `ReusableSmallComponents` (non-buttons)

### What was changed and why

Converted remaining JS/JSX in `components/ReusableSmallComponents/`: GifHover, list/heading helpers, ShowTime, icons/SVGs, author row. Renamed `SmallCenteredheading.jsx` → `SmallCenteredHeading.tsx`. Removed unused `Image` import from author row component. `PostersImageUsernameProfileName` still has zero external imports.

### Files created

## 2026-06-07 — Delete `PostersImageUsernameProfileName`; backlog `ShowTime`

### What was changed and why

Removed dead `PostersImageUsernameProfileName` — superseded by inline author UI in `ContentListing`. Kept `ShowTime` for future use; added `docs/FUTURE.md` section to revisit timestamps on content rows and notification listings.

### Files removed

- `components/ReusableSmallComponents/PostersImageUsernameProfileName.tsx`

### Files modified

- `components/Shared/media/ShowTime.tsx` — FUTURE.md pointer in header

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: admin stack + ParagraphRender

### What was changed and why

Converted admin context/wrapper, nav dropdown, and paragraph helper to TypeScript. Fixed `AdminWrapper` to pass `isAdminServer={isAdmin}` (was `isAdmin` prop name mismatch — server seed never reached provider). Removed unused `AdminProvider` import from `(admin)/layout.jsx`. Renamed default export to `AdminDropdownMenu` (file name match).

### Files created

- `context/AdminContext.tsx`

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: NavBar + layout wrappers

### What was changed and why

Converted primary header (mobile + desktop nav, profile menu) and four layout client wrappers to TypeScript. `NavBarLink` now uses `usePathname()` instead of broken `router.pathname` (App Router). Removed dead imports from nav modules. Renamed `AddItemsDropDownMenu` default export to match filename.

### Files created

- `components/NavBar/NavLayoutwithSettingsMenu.tsx`
- `components/NavBar/NavBarPieces/NavBarLink.tsx`

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: admin routes, landing page, protected layout

### What was changed and why

Converted the admin route group (layout + four category/tag forms), public landing page (`app/page` + `HeroTop`), and protected route-group layout to TypeScript. Added `.d.ts` stubs for `MediaObjectLeft` / `MediaObjectRight` so landing sections type-check without converting those JSX components yet.

### Files created

- `app/(admin)/layout.tsx`
- `app/(admin)/addnamecategory/page.tsx`
- `app/(admin)/adddescriptioncategory/page.tsx`
- `app/(admin)/addnametag/page.tsx`

- `app/(protected)/layout.jsx`
- `app/page.js`
- `components/LandingPage/HeroTop.jsx`

### Files modified

- `docs/README.md`

### Problems encountered

- `app/page.tsx` failed `tsc` because inferred JSX props on `MediaObjectRight` required `credit` / `creditLink`. Fixed with optional props in `.d.ts` stubs (components still render correctly without credits).

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm build` — OK

### Next logical step

Convert `MediaObjectLeft` / `MediaObjectRight` to `.tsx` (replace `.d.ts`), then `Footer`, `about/page.jsx`, `(protected)/editsettings/page.js`, or remaining `app/api/**/*.js`.

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: MediaObject, Footer, about, editsettings

### What was changed and why

Converted landing marketing blocks (`MediaObjectLeft`/`Right`), site footer, about page, and edit-settings profile form to TypeScript. Replaced temporary `.d.ts` stubs with real `.tsx` modules. Fixed `FooterLink` to use `usePathname()` (App Router). Removed dead code and legacy `ProfileScreen.auth`.

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm build` — OK

### Next logical step

Remaining `app/api/**/*.js`, auth UI (`login`, `register`, `forgotpassword`), `ImageUpload`, or `LoadingScreen.jsx`.

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: remaining API routes, ImageUpload, LoadingScreen

### What was changed and why

Converted the last 19 `app/api/**/*.js` route handlers (auth, user profile, category/tag admin, forgot/verify reset password, legacy name route) plus `ImageUpload` and `LoadingScreen`. **`app/api` is now fully TypeScript.** Stripped large Pages Router comment blocks; added grouped API notes under `docs/notes/app/api/`.

### Files created

- 19 `app/api/**/route.ts` files (see git for full list)
- `app/api/auth/lib/mongodb.ts`
- `components/AddingNewData/ImageUpload.tsx`
- `components/LoadingScreen.tsx`

- `docs/notes/components/image-upload.md`, `loading-screen.md`

### Files removed

- All corresponding `.js` / `.jsx` listed above (zero `app/api/**/*.js` remain)

### Files modified

- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/notes/lib/auth.md`

### Problems encountered

- `auth/update`: narrowed `getSessionForApis` union before accessing `session`.
- `forgotpassword`: `resetTokenExpires` typed as `Date` on User model.
- `names/likes/[contentId]`: GET used wrong param name (`id` → `contentId`); fixed bug from JS original.
- Removed invalid `onClick` on `DisabledButton` in ImageUpload (prop not supported).

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm build` — OK

### Next logical step

Auth UI pages (`login`, `register`, `forgotpassword`, `ResetPassword`, `magiclink`), `EditBioAndProfile.jsx`, or enable `strict: true` once remaining `components/**/*.jsx` are converted.

---

## 2026-06-07 — Docs: NextAuth App Router route note

### What was changed and why

Preserved the original `[...nextauth]` comment explaining why the route exports `NextAuth` as GET/POST instead of separate route logic. Placed in `docs/notes/lib/auth.md`; route file points to that section.

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/lib/auth.md`
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- `CHANGES.md`

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: auth UI pages

### What was changed and why

Converted login, register, forgot password, reset password, and magic link screens to TypeScript. Register form was already TS; only the page wrapper moved.

### Files created

- `components/login.tsx`, `forgotpassword.tsx`, `ResetPassword.tsx`
- `app/login/page.tsx`, `app/register/page.tsx`, `app/forgotpassword/page.tsx`
- `app/resetpassword/[token]/page.tsx`, `app/magiclink/page.tsx`
- `docs/notes/app/auth-pages.md`

### Files removed

- All corresponding `.js` / `.jsx` auth UI files

### Files modified

- `docs/README.md`

### Problems encountered

- `NounBlackCatIcon` no longer accepts `fill` prop — removed from login/magiclink.
- Fixed missing `redirect` import on reset password page; cleaned dead code in `ResetPassword`.

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm build` — OK

### Next logical step

Delete dead JS (`AddComment.js`, `removeDeletedContent.jsx`, etc.) or enable `strict: true`.

---

## 2026-06-07 — Auth UI: restore section skim comments

Re-added `{/* <!-- … --> */}` / banner section comments in `login.tsx`, `forgotpassword.tsx`, `ResetPassword.tsx`, and `magiclink/page.tsx` for easier navigation.

## 2026-06-07 — Auth UI: preserve behavioral notes

Expanded `docs/notes/app/auth-pages.md` with implementation notes per `preserving-migration-notes.md`. Re-added short inline `//` comments in auth `.tsx` files (useSession timing, `redirect: false`, honeypot, forgot-password enumeration safety).

---

## 2026-06-07 — TypeScript: profile/dashboard polish, error pages, meta routes

### What was changed and why

Converted ranking/points UI, profile edit modal, error pages, robots/sitemap routes, and stub `fetchusers` / `test` pages to TypeScript.

### Files created

- `components/EditingData/EditBioAndProfile.tsx`
- `components/Ranking/PointSystemList.tsx`, `RankingTotals.tsx`, `RankNames.tsx`
- `components/Contact/ErrorContactMessage.tsx`
- `app/not-found.tsx`, `app/global-error.tsx`
- `app/robots.txt/route.ts`, `app/sitemap.xml/route.ts`
- `app/fetchusers/page.tsx`, `app/test/page.tsx`
- Docs under `docs/notes/components/` and `docs/notes/app/`

### Files removed

- All corresponding `.js` / `.jsx` for the above

### Files modified

- `components/profile.tsx` — pass real `setShowProfileEditPage` / `setProfileChange` setters (fix close/save toggling bug); guard modal with `session`
- `docs/README.md`, `docs/notes/components/profile.md`

### Problems encountered

- `global-error` now includes required `<html>` / `<body>` wrapper per Next.js App Router.
- `RankNames` simplified to `{ points: number }` (same math as old `Object.values` hack).

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm build` — OK

### Next logical step

Auth UI (`login`, `register`, `forgotpassword`, `ResetPassword`, `magiclink`) or delete dead JS (`AddComment.js`, `removeDeletedContent.jsx`, etc.).

---

## 2026-06-07 — `strict: true` + migration cleanup fixes

### What was built and why

Enabled full TypeScript strict mode now that app/components/hooks are converted. Fixed ~21 strict errors (mongoose model generics, SWR mutate signatures, react-select typing, form validators, module stubs) and aligned hook generics for edit/delete flows.

### Files created

- `types/modules.d.ts` — ambient declarations for `react-google-recaptcha` and `mongoose-unique-validator`

### Files modified

- `tsconfig.json` — `strict: true`
- `utils/api/getPaginatedNotifications.ts` — generic `Model<TDoc extends Document>`
- `hooks/useEditHandler.ts`, `hooks/useDeleteConfirmation.ts`, `hooks/useSwrPagination.ts` — optional SWR `mutate` updater; generic page/item types
- `components/CoreListingPagesLogic.tsx` — optional `reset` default on `handleApplyFilters`
- `components/ShowingListOfContent/ContentListing.tsx` — typed edit/delete/mutate wiring; explicit `ToggeableAlert` generics
- `components/Shared/feedback/ToggeableAlert.tsx` — generic dismiss state
- `components/FormComponents/StyledSelect.tsx` — typed dynamic `react-select` import
- `components/Suggestions/SuggestionButton.tsx` — `SuggestionContentInfo` props
- `components/Register/RegisterForm.tsx`, `components/Contact/ContactForm.tsx` — reCAPTCHA + validate callback types
- `components/EmailTemplates/EmailTemplateComponents/email-button.tsx` — typed props

### Problems encountered

- `ToggeableAlert` generic inference narrowed `boolean` to literal `true` inside `{flag && <Alert …>}` — fixed with explicit `<ToggeableAlert<boolean>>`.
- `StyledSelect` `StylesConfig<…, true>` forced `isMulti` literal — widened to `boolean`.

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK (`strict: true`)
- `pnpm build` — OK

### Docs

- `docs/notes/typescript/strict-mode-fixes.md` — all 21 strict errors with messages, before/after code, and rationale
- `docs/README.md` — index link added

### TODOs / next logical step

- Consider `moduleResolution: "bundler"`.

## 2026-06-07 — Legacy JS cleanup verification + `tsconfig` include tighten

### What was built and why

Confirmed the stale-JS cleanup pass: `app/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `context/`, `wrappers/`, `lib/`, `models/`, and `app/api/` have **no** `.js`/`.jsx` on disk or in git (only TypeScript). Dead files (`useOnScreen.js`, `removeDeletedContent.jsx`, empty `AddComment.js`, commented `addingCategory.jsx`, superseded `AddDescriptionCategory.jsx`) were already removed in commit `67e5d13`. Tightened `tsconfig.json` `include` so TypeScript no longer scans wildcard `**/*.js` / `**/*.jsx` for app code — only `migrations/`, `codemods/`, `scripts/`, and root `*.config.js` remain JS in the repo (29 files).

### Files modified

- `tsconfig.json` — replaced `**/*.js` / `**/*.jsx` with explicit migration/codemod/script/config globs

### Verification

- Repo scan: **0** stale JS/JSX twins (no basename with both `.ts(x)` and `.js(x)`)
- `git ls-files "*.js" "*.jsx"` — 29 files (migrations, codemods, config only)
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm build` — OK

### Next logical step

- Optional: convert `next.config.js` / Tailwind / PostCSS to `.ts` or `.mjs` if you want zero root `.js` in `include`.

---

## 2026-06-07 — Jest → Vitest migration

### What was built and why

Replaced Jest with Vitest for unit/component tests. Vitest aligns better with the Vite/ESM toolchain and is a natural fit for a Next 15 + TypeScript codebase. Playwright E2E unchanged.

### Files created

- `vitest.config.ts` — jsdom default, path aliases, excludes `e2e/` and migration folders
- `vitest.setup.ts` — `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest` + TextEncoder polyfill
- `vitest.env.d.ts` — `vitest/globals` types for `describe` / `it` / `vi`
- `docs/notes/vitest-setup.md`

### Files removed

- `jest.config.ts`, `jest.setup.ts`, `docs/notes/jest-setup.md`

### Files modified

- `package.json` — `vitest`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `jsdom`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`; removed `jest`, `jest-environment-jsdom`, `@types/jest`; scripts `test` / `test:watch` / `test:ci`
- `tsconfig.json` — include `vitest.env.d.ts`
- `utils/debounce.test.ts`, `utils/startCooldown.test.ts`, `utils/api/rateLimiter.test.ts`, `utils/stringManipulation/findNormalizedMatch.test.ts` — `jest.*` → `vi.*`
- `utils/mongoDataCleanup.test.ts` — `@vitest-environment node`
- `TESTING.md`, `docs/README.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm install` — OK
- `pnpm test` — OK (20 files, 111 tests)
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm build` — OK

---

## 2026-06-07 — First RTL batch + API auth guard tests

### What was built and why

Started the testing improvement plan: React Testing Library for leaf alert components, Vitest unit tests for `checkOwnership` / `checkIfAdmin` (high-risk API guards with no prior coverage).

### Files created

- `components/Shared/feedback/WarningMessage.test.tsx`
- `components/Shared/feedback/ToggeableAlert.test.tsx`
- `utils/api/checkOwnership.test.ts`
- `utils/api/checkIfAdmin.test.ts`

### Patterns

- RTL: `userEvent` + small `useState` harnesses for dismiss behavior
- API guards: `vi.hoisted` mock of `getSessionForApis` so tests do not import `lib/auth` / require `MONGODB_URI`

### Problems encountered

**`checkOwnership` / `checkIfAdmin` — `MONGODB_URI not defined`**

Importing `getSessionForApis` in the test file still loaded the real module → `lib/auth` → `utils/db` → throws without `MONGODB_URI`.

Failed approach:

```ts
import { getSessionForApis } from "./getSessionForApis";
vi.mock("./getSessionForApis");
// vi.mocked(getSessionForApis) still evaluates real module graph
```

Fix — `vi.hoisted` mock before imports:

```ts
const mocks = vi.hoisted(() => ({
  getSessionForApis: vi.fn(),
}));

vi.mock("./getSessionForApis", () => ({
  getSessionForApis: mocks.getSessionForApis,
}));

import { checkOwnership } from "./checkOwnership";

mocks.getSessionForApis.mockResolvedValue({
  ok: true,
  session: { user: { id: "creator-42", role: "user", status: "active" }, expires: "…" },
});
```

### Files modified

- `TESTING.md` — unit/component coverage table

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — OK (24 files, 126 tests)

### Next logical step

- `MustLoginMessage`, `StyledCheckbox`, `PreserveTextAfterSubmission` (more leaf RTL)
- `CheckIfContentExists` with mocked `fetch`

---

## 2026-06-07 — Second RTL batch (forms, gate, duplicate check)

### What was built and why

Continued RTL expansion: sign-in gate, checkbox components, and duplicate-check UI with mocked `fetch`. Added global `matchMedia` stub in `vitest.setup.ts` for `LoadingSpinner` during async check tests.

### Files created

- `components/Shared/feedback/MustLoginMessage.test.tsx`
- `components/FormComponents/StyledCheckbox.test.tsx`
- `components/AddingNewData/preserveTextAfterSubmission.test.tsx`
- `components/AddingNewData/CheckIfContentExists.test.tsx`

### Files modified

- `vitest.setup.ts` — `window.matchMedia` stub (guarded for jsdom only)
- `docs/notes/vitest-setup.md`, `TESTING.md`

### Patterns

- `CheckIfContentExists` test harness restores parent `value` after child mount reset effect
- `ContentListing` mocked to a stub for show-content flow
- `vi.stubGlobal("fetch", …)` per test file

### Problems encountered

#### 1. `CheckIfContentExists` — duplicate/success messages never appeared

On mount, `resetData("")` runs via `resetTrigger` effect and clears parent `value` through `onChange`. Search stays disabled when `contentCheck.length < 2`.

Source (`CheckIfContentExists.tsx`):

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  resetData(""); // calls parent onChange("") on mount
}, [resetTrigger]);
```

Failed approach:

```ts
const [value, setValue] = useState(initial); // initial = "fluffy"
// after child mount effect → value becomes ""
```

Fix (`CheckIfContentExists.test.tsx` harness):

```ts
const [value, setValue] = useState("");

// Child resets parent value on mount; restore query text
useEffect(() => {
  setValue(initial);
}, [initial]);
```

#### 2. `window.matchMedia is not a function`

Search → `checkIsProcessing` → `LoadingSpinner` → `usePrefersReducedMotions` → `window.matchMedia` (missing in jsdom).

```
TypeError: window.matchMedia is not a function
❯ hooks/usePrefersReducedMotions.ts
```

Fix (`vitest.setup.ts`):

```ts
if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  Object.defineProperty(window, "matchMedia", {
    writable: true,
    value: (query: string) => ({
      matches: false,
      media: query,
      onchange: null,
      addListener: () => {},
      removeListener: () => {},
      addEventListener: () => {},
      removeEventListener: () => {},
      dispatchEvent: () => false,
    }),
  });
}
```

Without `typeof window !== "undefined"`, node-env suites fail:

```
ReferenceError: window is not defined
❯ vitest.setup.ts (mongoDataCleanup.test.ts, @vitest-environment node)
```

#### 3. `StyledCheckbox` — `onChange` `target.checked` assertion failed

Failed approach:

```ts
const onChange = vi.fn();
render(
  <StyledCheckbox label="Keep text" value="keep-text" checked={false} onChange={onChange} />,
);
await user.click(screen.getByRole("checkbox", { name: /keep text/i }));
expect(onChange.mock.calls[0][0].target.checked).toBe(true); // got false
```

Fix — controlled wrapper + `toBeChecked()`:

```tsx
function ControlledCheckbox(props) {
  const [checked, setChecked] = useState(false);
  return (
    <StyledCheckbox
      {...props}
      checked={checked}
      onChange={(e) => setChecked(e.target.checked)}
    />
  );
}

render(<ControlledCheckbox label="Keep text" value="keep-text" />);
const checkbox = screen.getByRole("checkbox", { name: /keep text/i });
expect(checkbox).not.toBeChecked();
await user.click(checkbox);
expect(checkbox).toBeChecked();
```

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — OK (28 files, 141 tests)

### Next logical step

- `RegisterForm` client validation (mock reCAPTCHA)
- Thanks notifications E2E (still no Playwright coverage)

---

## 2026-06-07 — `RegisterForm` RTL tests

### What was built and why

Client-side validation and server error mapping for the register form — fills the gap between `validateSignupSubmission` unit tests and Playwright duplicate-email E2E.

### Files created

- `components/Register/RegisterForm.test.tsx`

### Files modified

- `TESTING.md` — Register form row in coverage table

### Patterns

- Mock stack: `next/image`, `next/navigation`, `next-auth/react`, reCAPTCHA v2/v3, `isE2eClientMode` (captcha bypass), `axios` via `vi.hoisted`
- `fillRegisterForm` / `submitRegister` helpers for repeated form interaction
- `form.noValidate = true` before submit so HTML5 `type="email"` does not block react-hook-form pattern errors in jsdom

### Problems encountered

**HTML5 email validation blocked RHF pattern test**

`type="email"` + `not-an-email` prevented form submit in jsdom; `handleSubmit` never ran, so "Please enter a valid email" never rendered.

Fix:

```ts
async function submitRegister(user) {
  const form = document.querySelector("form");
  if (form) form.noValidate = true;
  await user.click(screen.getByRole("button", { name: /register/i }));
}
```

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — OK (29 files, 147 tests)

### Next logical step

- Thanks notifications E2E (`e2e/notifications.spec.ts` extension or new spec)
- `RegisterInput` leaf tests (optional; mostly covered via `RegisterForm`)

---

## 2026-06-07 — Thanks notifications E2E

### What was built and why

Extended Playwright notification coverage for the thanks flow — previously only the unauthenticated 401 on `/api/notifications/thanks` was tested.

### Files created

- `e2e/helpers/thanks.ts` — `submitThanks`, `expectSelfThankRejected`

### Files modified

- `e2e/notifications.spec.ts` — thank populate (name + description), self-thank 400, `PATCH .../thanks/mark-read`
- `TESTING.md` — E2E coverage list + manual checklist note

### Patterns

- Serial suite with like tests: admin submits thanks → regular user reads `/api/notifications/thanks`
- Seeded `SEED_NAME` / `SEED_DESCRIPTION_START` (owned by playwright user) + admin as thanker
- Mark-read test skips if no thank rows (same pattern as names mark-read)

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — OK (unit/component unchanged, 147 tests)
- `pnpm test:e2e` — requires `MONGODB_URI_TEST` + seed; run locally against test DB

### Next logical step

- `/notifications` UI thanks tab (Playwright browser assertions)
- Description/thanks `mark-read` UI persistence on `/notifications` page

---

## 2026-06-07 — Notifications thanks tab UI E2E

### What was built and why

Browser-level coverage for `/notifications` Thanks tab — populated rows and the 3s mark-read badge clear that the API-only tests could not assert.

### Files created

- `e2e/notifications-ui.spec.ts` — thanks tab rows (name + description), unread badge clears after tab stays open
- `e2e/helpers/notifications-ui.ts` — `gotoNotificationsPage`, `openThanksTab`, `thanksUnreadBadge`, `leaveThanksTabBeforeMarkRead`

### Files modified

- `TESTING.md` — E2E coverage + manual checklist (thanks UI covered; descriptions tab UI still manual)

### Patterns

- Serial suite: name row test leaves Thanks tab before 3s timer so mark-read test still has unread badge
- Row locator: filter `div` by `thanked you` + content text; assert admin display name + default thank message
- Description row uses `SEED_DESCRIPTION_START.slice(0, 60) + "..."` to match `ThankNotificationListing` truncation
- Mark-read UI: `expect.poll` on badge count after `openThanksTab` + 3s client timer (`test.setTimeout(60_000)`)

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — OK (147 unit/component tests)
- `pnpm test:e2e e2e/notifications-ui.spec.ts` — requires `MONGODB_URI_TEST` + seed

### Next logical step

- `/notifications` descriptions tab UI rows
- Names tab mark-read badge UI (API mark-read already covered)

---

## 2026-06-07 — Component folder reorg (`Shared/`)

### What was built and why

Replaced size-based `ReusableSmallComponents/` and `ReusableMediumComponents/` with purpose-based `components/Shared/` so new contributors know where generic UI lives.

### Files created

- [`components/README.md`](components/README.md) — “where to put new code” decision guide
- `components/Shared/{actions,feedback,icons,typography,media,lists,layout,content-actions}/` — 33 moved components + tests

### Files removed

- `components/ReusableSmallComponents/` (entire tree)
- `components/ReusableMediumComponents/` (entire tree)

### Files modified

- ~74 source/doc files — import paths updated to `@components/Shared/...`
- [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md), [`reusable-buttons.md`](docs/notes/components/reusable-buttons.md), [`reusable-small-components.md`](docs/notes/components/reusable-small-components.md)
- [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) — test file paths in coverage table

### Mapping

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| `ReusableSmallComponents/buttons/*` (generic) | `shared/actions/` |
| `WarningMessage`, `ToggeableAlert`, `ui/MustLoginMessage` | `shared/feedback/` |
| icons, `IconWithCount` | `shared/icons/` |
| headings | `shared/typography/` |
| `ProfileImage`, `GifHover`, `ShowTime` | `shared/media/` |
| `ListWithPawPrintIcon` | `shared/lists/` |
| `MediaObject*` | `shared/layout/` |
| like/follow/share | `shared/content-actions/` |

### Problems encountered

- **`iconOpenCloseButton`** relative import `../IconWithCount` broke after move → `../icons/IconWithCount`
- **`EditSuggestion`** still imported `../ui/MustLoginMessage` after `MustLoginMessage` moved to `shared/feedback/`

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm test` — OK (29 files, 147 tests)

### Next logical step

- Optional naming cleanup: `IconWithCount.tsx` → `IconBadge.tsx`, `ToggeableAlert` → `ToggleableAlert`

---

## 2026-06-07 — Move `components/ui/` into `Shared/ui/`

### What was built and why

`LoadingSpinner` and `skeleton` are app-wide shared primitives — nesting them under `Shared/ui/` matches the rest of the `shared/` taxonomy.

### Files moved

- `components/ui/LoadingSpinner.tsx` → `components/Shared/ui/LoadingSpinner.tsx`
- `components/ui/skeleton.tsx` + `skeleton.test.tsx` → `components/Shared/ui/`

### Files modified

- ~16 import sites (`@components/Shared/ui/...`, `../Shared/ui/...`)
- [`components/README.md`](components/README.md) — decision table + tree
- [`components.json`](components.json) — shadcn `ui` alias → `@/components/Shared/ui`
- [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md), [`small-ui-components.md`](docs/notes/components/ui/small-ui-components.md), [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md)

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm test` — OK (29 files, 147 tests)

---

## 2026-06-07 — PascalCase `Footer/` and `Shared/` folder names

### What was built and why

Top-level component folders now match the repo convention (`Notifications/`, `FormComponents/`). Category subfolders inside `Shared/` stay lowercase (`actions/`, `ui/`).

### Renamed

- `components/footer/` → `components/Footer/`
- `components/shared/` → `components/Shared/`

### Files modified

- ~75 import and doc path updates (`@components/Shared/...`, `@/components/Footer/...`)
- [`components/README.md`](components/README.md) — folder naming rule + PascalCase links
- [`components.json`](components.json), [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md), docs index

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm test` — OK (29 files, 147 tests)

---

## 2026-06-07 — Likes server prefetch (Option B)

### What was built and why

Signed-in users saw wrong heart state until client `GET /api/user/likes` finished. Root layout now prefetches likes and seeds `LikesProvider` on first paint (see `docs/FUTURE.md` Option B).

### Files created

- `utils/api/getUserLikes.ts` — `getUserLikesForUserId`
- `utils/api/userLikesResponse.ts` — types + `buildLikesMapsFromResponse`
- `utils/api/getUserLikes.test.ts` — map builder unit tests

### Files modified

- `app/api/user/likes/route.ts` — thin handler; delegates to `getUserLikesForUserId`
- `context/LikesContext.tsx` — optional `initialLikes`; skip first client fetch when server-seeded
- `wrappers/LikesWrapper.tsx` — passes `initialLikes` prop
- `app/layout.tsx` — prefetch when session has user id
- `docs/notes/app/api/user-likes-route.md`, `docs/notes/app/root-layout.md`, `docs/FUTURE.md`, `docs/README.md`

### Patterns

- One fetch helper for API route + server layout (same shape as `UserLikesResponse`)
- Client fetch still runs after client-only login; toggles still use `addLike` / `deleteLike`
- No page-level `NameLikes` props on listing pages

### Verification

- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — OK
- `pnpm test` — OK (30 files, 149 tests)

### Next logical step

- Manual: signed-in listing page — hearts correct on first paint without flash

---

## 2026-06-07 — Restore LikesContext inline comments

### What changed

Re-added explanatory comments removed during likes prefetch refactor: `recentLikesRef` session deltas, logout reset, SSR skip-fetch, AbortController/magic-link note, legacy `getLikeStatus` sketch, usage examples at file bottom. Updated bottom example to current `addLike("names", contentId)` signature.

### Files modified

- `context/LikesContext.tsx`
- `utils/api/getUserLikes.ts` — parallel query comment
- `app/api/user/likes/route.ts` — session comment

---

## 2026-06-07 — RTL batch: LikesContext, ShowTime, ListWithPawPrintIcon

### What was built and why

Expanded Vitest coverage after likes server prefetch — context behavior, plus two untested shared components.

### Files created

- `context/LikesContext.test.tsx` — SSR hydrate, client fetch, add/delete, logout, post-login fetch
- `components/Shared/media/ShowTime.test.tsx` — mocked `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, styling
- `components/Shared/lists/ListWithPawPrintIcon.test.tsx` — text + `className`

### Patterns

- `LikesContext` stores state in refs — tests use `LikesCapture` + imperative `hasLiked` / `getLikedIds`, and `LikesPoll` for async fetch (no re-render on ref mutation)
- `vi.hoisted` mock of `useSession`; `fetch` stubbed globally
- `ShowTime` — mock `Intl.DateTimeFormat` to avoid locale flakiness

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — OK (33 files, 159 tests)

### Next logical step

- `useLikeState` hook tests (mock `useLikes` + toggle API)
- E2E: descriptions tab UI on `/notifications`

---

## 2026-06-07 — useLikeState, GeneralButton tests + descriptions tab E2E

### What was built and why

Follow-up testing batch: like toggle optimistic logic, primary button component, descriptions notifications UI.

### Files created

- `hooks/useLikeState.test.ts` — count + `addLike`/`deleteLike` via mocked `useToggleState`
- `components/Shared/actions/GeneralButton.test.tsx` — click, disabled, aria-label, children, warning variant

### Files modified

- `e2e/helpers/notifications-ui.ts` — `openDescriptionsTab`, `descriptionsTabButton`
- `e2e/notifications-ui.spec.ts` — descriptions tab like row after admin like
- `TESTING.md` — coverage table + E2E list; descriptions tab removed from manual checklist

### Patterns

- `useLikeState` tests capture `onApplyOptimistic` / `onRollback` from mocked `useToggleState` (avoids debounce/fetch)
- Descriptions UI row locator: `Liked •` + truncated `SEED_DESCRIPTION_START`

### Verification

- `pnpm test` — OK (35 files, 168 tests)
- `pnpm test:e2e e2e/notifications-ui.spec.ts` — requires `MONGODB_URI_TEST` + seed

### Next logical step

- Names tab UI row on `/notifications` (API already covered)
- `useToggleState` unit tests with fake timers + mocked fetch

---

## 2026-06-07 — Fix notifications UI E2E strict mode (duplicate rows)

### Problem

Serial `notifications-ui.spec.ts` reruns append thank/like rows to the test DB. `row.getByText('E2E Admin')` matched **two** description thank rows → Playwright strict mode violation.

### Fix

`notificationRow()` helper uses `.first()` on filtered rows; assertions use `toContainText` on that single row.

### Files modified

- `e2e/helpers/notifications-ui.ts` — `notificationRow`
- `e2e/notifications-ui.spec.ts` — all row assertions
- `TESTING.md` — duplicate-row / strict-mode note under `notifications-ui.spec.ts`

### Next logical step

- `useToggleState` unit tests with fake timers + mocked fetch
- `/notifications` UI — names tab mark-read badge (API covered)

---

## 2026-06-07 — Names tab UI E2E (`notifications-ui.spec.ts`)

### What was built and why

Browser assertion for name like notifications — API was covered in `notifications.spec.ts`; names tab is the SSR default on `/notifications` so no tab click is required.

### Files modified

- `e2e/notifications-ui.spec.ts` — admin like on `SEED_NAME` → user sees `Liked •` row
- `e2e/helpers/notifications-ui.ts` — `namesTabButton`, `openNamesTab` (for future tab-switch tests)
- `TESTING.md` — E2E coverage bullet

### Verification

- `pnpm test:e2e e2e/notifications-ui.spec.ts` — requires `MONGODB_URI_TEST` + seed

## 2026-06-07 — `useToggleState` unit tests + names tab mark-read E2E

### What was built and why

- **`hooks/useToggleState.test.ts`** — covers optimistic flip, debounced POST, `onApplyOptimistic` / `onRollback`, rate-limit skip, and in-flight toggle guard. Mocks `useApiRateLimiter`; fake timers for 500ms debounce; absolute `apiUrl` so unmount `flush` does not hit invalid relative URLs in Node.
- **Names tab mark-read UI** — mirrors thanks-tab badge test; names tab is SSR default so no tab click needed.

### Files created / modified

- `hooks/useToggleState.test.ts` (new)
- `e2e/notifications-ui.spec.ts` — names tab mark-read test
- `e2e/helpers/notifications-ui.ts` — `namesUnreadBadge`
- `TESTING.md` — coverage bullets

### Verification

- `pnpm test hooks/useToggleState.test.ts` — 6 passed
- `pnpm test:e2e e2e/notifications-ui.spec.ts` — run locally with seed

### Next logical step

- `/notifications` UI — mark read persists after reload (manual checklist item)
- Optional: `useApiRateLimiter` unit tests

---

## 2026-06-08 — `useApiRateLimiter` tests + mark-read persists after reload

### What was built and why

- **`hooks/useApiRateLimiter.test.ts`** — limit enforcement, window reset via `setInterval`, default options.
- **Mark-read persist** — thanks and names mark-read E2E tests now reload `/notifications` after badge clears and assert badge stays absent (DB `read: true` survives refetch).
- **`reloadNotificationsPage`** helper waits for `GET /api/user/notifications` after reload.

### Files created / modified

- `hooks/useApiRateLimiter.test.ts` (new)
- `e2e/helpers/notifications-ui.ts` — `reloadNotificationsPage`
- `e2e/notifications-ui.spec.ts` — persist assertions on thanks + names mark-read tests
- `TESTING.md` — coverage + checklist updates

### Verification

- `pnpm test hooks/useApiRateLimiter.test.ts` — 4 passed
- `pnpm test:e2e e2e/notifications-ui.spec.ts` — run locally with seed

### Next logical step

- Like toggle on name detail UI — rapid double-click E2E

---

## 2026-06-08 — Descriptions tab mark-read (API + UI E2E)

### What was built and why

Completes the notifications tab trilogy: thanks and names already had mark-read UI + persist-after-reload; descriptions had list UI only, no `PATCH descriptions/mark-read` API test.

### Files modified

- `e2e/helpers/notifications-ui.ts` — `descriptionsUnreadBadge`, `leaveDescriptionsTabBeforeMarkRead`
- `e2e/notifications-ui.spec.ts` — mark-read + reload persist test; descriptions like row leaves tab before timer
- `e2e/notifications.spec.ts` — `PATCH /api/notifications/descriptions/mark-read`
- `TESTING.md` — API + UI coverage bullets

### Verification

- `pnpm exec playwright test e2e/notifications-ui.spec.ts e2e/notifications.spec.ts --list` — 16 tests listed
- `pnpm test:e2e e2e/notifications-ui.spec.ts` — run locally with seed

### Next logical step

- Follow / unfollow via FollowButton UI

## 2026-06-08 — Fix like double-click E2E (OS dblclick interval)

### Problem

`likeButton.dblclick()` used the OS double-click gap (~500ms), matching `useToggleState` debounce — two separate `togglelike` POSTs.

### Fix

`rapidDoubleClick()` in `e2e/helpers/likes.ts` — two `mouse.click` calls at button center with no intentional delay.

---

## 2026-06-08 — Name detail like double-click E2E (`social.spec.ts`)

### What was built and why

Browser test for debounced `togglelike` on `/name/[name]`: rapid double-click sends one POST after 500ms debounce, no 5xx, like count changes by at most 1.

### Files modified

- `e2e/helpers/likes.ts` — `ensureNameUnliked`, `nameDetailLikeButton`
- `e2e/social.spec.ts` — double-click debounce test (admin, seeded name)
- `TESTING.md` — `social.spec` bullet + manual checklist note

### Verification

- `pnpm exec playwright test e2e/social.spec.ts --list` — 5 tests listed
- `pnpm test:e2e e2e/social.spec.ts` — run locally with seed

### Next logical step

- Follow / unfollow via FollowButton UI

---

## 2026-06-08 — Like debounce docs + settle-then-POST tests

### What was built and why

Documented and tested the existing client contract: optimistic UI on every click, one `togglelike` POST 500ms after the user stops clicking. No Option C click-blocking.

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/app/api/togglelike-route.md` — mermaid sequence diagram, lockout table, edge cases, stack, test index
- `hooks/useToggleState.ts` — client contract comment block
- `hooks/useToggleState.test.ts` — burst coalescing, like-then-unlike before settle, separate bursts
- `e2e/social.spec.ts` — like → pause 200ms → unlike → one POST E2E
- `TESTING.md` — social.spec bullets + checklist link to togglelike doc

### Verification

- `pnpm test hooks/useToggleState.test.ts` — 9 passed
- `pnpm exec playwright test e2e/social.spec.ts --list` — 6 tests listed

### Next logical step

- Follow / unfollow via FollowButton UI

## 2026-06-08 — Fix useToggleState flush on every optimistic re-render

### Problem

`useEffect` for `beforeunload` / unmount flush listed `canSend` in deps. `useApiRateLimiter` recreates `canSend` every render, so each `setActive` from a like click ran effect cleanup → `debouncedCommit.flush()` → immediate POST. Like → unlike within 500ms sent **two** POSTs instead of one.

### Fix

- `canSendRef` / `registerSendRef` for stable reads inside debounce and flush
- Flush effect deps: `[debouncedCommit]` only
- Unit test: rerender after toggle → still one POST
- E2E: `likeThenUnlikeWithinDebounce` helper (mouse clicks)

### Files modified

- `hooks/useToggleState.ts`
- `hooks/useToggleState.test.ts`
- `e2e/helpers/likes.ts`, `e2e/social.spec.ts`
- `docs/notes/app/api/togglelike-route.md`

## 2026-06-08 — togglelike doc: edge cases Handled? column

### What changed

[`docs/notes/app/api/togglelike-route.md`](docs/notes/app/api/togglelike-route.md) edge cases table now includes **Handled?** (Yes / Partial / No) for each scenario, plus rows for fetch rollback, tab close flush, and logged-out gate.

---

## 2026-06-08 — Like toggle rate limit (client + server)

### What was built and why

Harden like toggles against abuse without lying in the UI: **3 POSTs / 2 minutes** per user, shared preset on client and server. Client blocks clicks **before** optimistic UI and shows pagination-style “Please wait X secs”; server returns **429** + `retryAfterSeconds` if bypassed (multi-tab / direct API).

### Files created

- `utils/api/likeToggleRateLimit.ts` — `checkLikeToggleRateLimit`, `likeToggleRateLimitResponse`

### Files modified

- `utils/api/rateLimiter.ts` — `LIKE_TOGGLE_RATE_LIMIT`, `rateLimitPresets.likeToggle`
- `utils/api/rateLimiter.test.ts` — preset assertion
- `app/api/names/likes/[contentId]/togglelike/route.ts` — 429 after auth
- `app/api/description/likes/[contentId]/togglelike/route.ts` — 429 + `getSessionForApis({ req })` fix
- `hooks/useApiRateLimiter.ts` — sliding window, `remainingSeconds`, `applyServerCooldown`, `isRateLimited`
- `hooks/useApiRateLimiter.test.ts` — updated coverage
- `hooks/useToggleState.ts` — block before optimistic UI; 429 rollback + server cooldown
- `hooks/useToggleState.test.ts` — rate limit block, 429 rollback tests
- `hooks/useLikeState.ts` — pass through `isRateLimited`, `remainingSeconds`
- `components/Shared/content-actions/LikesButtonAndLikesLogic.tsx` — disabled + cooldown message
- `docs/notes/app/api/togglelike-route.md` — 429 section, edge case row, locked-vs-not table

### Patterns followed

- Same rate-limit UX as pagination (`useApiRateLimiter` + “Please wait X secs”)
- Shared `LIKE_TOGGLE_RATE_LIMIT` constant imported by client hook and server helper
- Rollback on 429 matches fetch-failure path (no `registerSend` on failed commit)

### Verification

- `pnpm test hooks/useApiRateLimiter.test.ts hooks/useToggleState.test.ts utils/api/rateLimiter.test.ts hooks/useLikeState.test.ts` — 26 passed
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`

### Next logical step

- Follow / unfollow via FollowButton UI E2E

## 2026-06-08 — Fix social E2E like setup hitting togglelike rate limit

### Problem

Serial `social.spec.ts` tests share the in-memory server rate limiter (3 POSTs / 2 min per user). Test 6 failed in `ensureNameUnliked` with **429** after tests 1 and 5 consumed the admin quota. Helpers also blind-toggled (2 POSTs when already in target state).

### Fix

- [`e2e/helpers/likes.ts`](e2e/helpers/likes.ts) — `GET /api/user/likes` before setup; POST only when state must change
- [`utils/api/likeToggleRateLimit.ts`](utils/api/likeToggleRateLimit.ts) — relaxed cap (50 / 2 min) when `E2E_TEST_MODE`; production unchanged
- [`utils/api/e2eTestMode.ts`](utils/api/e2eTestMode.ts) — `isE2eServerMode()`

### Verification

- `pnpm test:e2e e2e/social.spec.ts`


### What changed

[`docs/notes/app/api/togglelike-route.md`](docs/notes/app/api/togglelike-route.md) — OS double-click at the debounce boundary is **Yes (acceptable)**, not a sync bug: two POSTs (like then unlike) leave UI and DB aligned; only an extra API call / rate-limit slot. Clarified that OS timing at ~500ms behaves like two intentional bursts.

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/app/api/togglelike-route.md`

## 2026-06-08 — E2E: togglelike 429 on 4th POST (production rate limit)

### What was built and why

Verify server **429** on the real `togglelike` route without breaking serial UI tests that use the relaxed E2E cap.

### Files created

- `app/api/test/e2e/reset-like-toggle-rate-limit/route.ts` — E2E-only; clears in-memory counter for signed-in user

### Files modified

- `utils/api/likeToggleRateLimit.ts` — `x-e2e-strict-like-rate-limit: 1` header applies production cap; `resetLikeToggleRateLimit`
- `app/api/names/likes/[contentId]/togglelike/route.ts`, `app/api/description/likes/[contentId]/togglelike/route.ts` — `checkLikeToggleRateLimitForRequest`
- `e2e/helpers/likes.ts` — `resetLikeToggleRateLimitForSession`, `postNameToggleLikeWithProductionRateLimit`
- `e2e/social.spec.ts` — 4 strict POSTs → `[200, 200, 200, 429]`
- `docs/notes/app/api/togglelike-route.md`, `TESTING.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm test:e2e e2e/social.spec.ts` — 7 passed

## 2026-06-08 — FUTURE.md: follow / unfollow UI E2E backlog

### What changed

Documented deferred Playwright coverage for `FollowButton` when profile follow/following modals are re-enabled. Cross-linked from `TESTING.md`, `updatefollows-route.md`, `docs/README.md`.

### Files modified

- `docs/FUTURE.md`
- `TESTING.md`
- `docs/notes/app/api/updatefollows-route.md`
- `docs/README.md`

## 2026-06-08 — Thanks flow UI E2E (`thanks-ui.spec.ts`)

### What was built and why

Playwright coverage for the full thanks UI path: `ThanksButton` → dialog → tag selection → `POST /api/thanks`, owner notification visibility, and self-thank button hidden on own content.

### Files created

- `e2e/thanks-ui.spec.ts`
- `e2e/helpers/thanks-ui.ts`

### Files modified

- `e2e/helpers/thanks.ts` — export `DEFAULT_THANK_MESSAGE`
- `components/Thanks/ThanksDialog.tsx` — backdrop `aria-hidden` no longer wraps `DialogPanel` (a11y + testability)
- `docs/notes/app/api/thanks-route.md` — tests table
- `TESTING.md`

### Verification

- `pnpm test:e2e e2e/thanks-ui.spec.ts` — 4 passed

### Next logical step

- Suggestion / report flows via UI E2E (if exposed on listing pages)

## 2026-06-08 — Unit tests: `getSessionForApis` + `lib/auth.ts`

### What was built and why

Smoke tests for the API session helper and NextAuth callbacks — closes the gap called out in `TESTING.md` for `lib/auth` without loading Mongo in consumers.

### Files created

- `utils/api/getSessionForApis.test.ts` — `getServerSession` mock; 401 vs ok; passes `serverAuthOptions`
- `lib/auth.test.ts` — `signIn`, `jwt`, `session` callbacks; credentials `authorize` (banned, password, success)

### Files modified

- `docs/notes/lib/auth.md` — test index
- `TESTING.md` — API auth guards row + migration checklist note

### Patterns followed

- `vi.hoisted` mocks for `getServerSession`, `User`, `db`, `bcryptjs` (same as `checkOwnership.test.ts`)
- `resolveSignInCallback` remains separately tested; `signIn` callback test asserts delegation

### Verification

- `pnpm test utils/api/getSessionForApis.test.ts lib/auth.test.ts` — 19 passed

### Next logical step

- Optional: integration test for `[...nextauth]` route (heavier; callbacks already covered)
